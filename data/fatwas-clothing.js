{id:'cl001',cat:'clothing',sub:'Hijab',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the extent of obligatory hijab for women?',a:'A woman must cover her entire body from non-mahram men except for the face (from the hairline to the chin, in the width that is washed in wudu) and the hands (from the wrist to the fingertips). The feet are also an area of scholarly debate — as an obligatory precaution, they should be covered. The covering must be: (1) Not transparent or see-through. (2) Not so tight that it reveals body contours (in a way that is considered immodest). (3) Not perfumed in a way that attracts non-mahram attention. Hair, neck, ears, and arms must be completely covered. This obligation begins at bulugh (religious maturity, around 9 lunar years for girls).',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2, Hijab',tags:['hijab','women','covering','obligation','extent']},
{id:'cl002',cat:'clothing',sub:'Men',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the awrah (area to cover) for men?',a:'The minimum awrah for men that must be covered at all times in the presence of non-mahram women is from the navel to the knee. However, men are also required to dress modestly and not wear clothing that is provocative, extremely tight, or revealing. While the technical awrah is navel to knee, Islamic etiquette (adab) calls for modest dress covering the body appropriately. Men must not wear pure silk or gold (as adornment) — these are haram for men but permissible for women. Transparent or extremely tight clothing that reveals body shape is discouraged. The standard is \'urfi — what is considered modest in the Muslim community.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['men','awrah','covering','modesty','silk','gold']},
{id:'cl003',cat:'clothing',sub:'Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'What clothing is required for prayer?',a:'For prayer, men must cover at minimum from the navel to the knees, though it is recommended to cover more including the shoulders. Women must cover everything except the face and hands (same as hijab rules). Additional prayer clothing conditions: (1) The clothing must be tahir (free from najasah). (2) It must not be made from the parts of a haram animal or an animal not slaughtered Islamically. (3) Men must not pray in pure silk. (4) Men must not pray wearing gold. (5) The clothing must not be usurped (ghasbi — stolen or taken without permission). (6) It should not be see-through. If one has only najis clothing, they pray in it; if they have no clothing at all, specific rules apply for praying while covering the awrah with hands.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Prayer clothing',tags:['prayer','clothing','conditions','men','women']},
{id:'cl004',cat:'clothing',sub:'Hijab',marja:'makarem',q:'Is the niqab (face covering) obligatory?',a:'The niqab (face veil) is not obligatory according to the majority of Shia scholars. The face of a woman is not awrah and does not need to be covered, provided it is not adorned with noticeable makeup intended to attract non-mahram attention. Covering the face is a recommended precaution in some scholars\' views but not an obligation. The obligatory hijab covers the hair, neck, ears, and body — the face (oval of the face) and hands to the wrist are exempt. If wearing facial makeup in public that constitutes zinah (beautification intended to attract), some scholars require either removing it or covering the face in that specific situation.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['niqab','face covering','women','obligatory','hijab']},
{id:'cl005',cat:'clothing',sub:'Men',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is it permissible for men to wear gold accessories?',a:'Wearing gold is haram for men in any form as adornment — this includes gold rings, gold watches, gold chains, gold bracelets, gold cufflinks, and any gold accessories. This is one of the unanimously agreed-upon rulings. Gold-plated items are also haram if the gold layer is considered gold by common understanding (\'urf). However, gold dental work (crowns, fillings) for medical purposes is permissible. White gold\'s ruling depends on its composition — if it is technically gold alloy, the prohibition applies. If one is given a gold item, they may own it but not wear it as adornment. Using gold utensils for eating/drinking is also prohibited for men.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gold','men','haram','ring','watch','adornment']},
{id:'cl006',cat:'clothing',sub:'General',marja:'wahid',q:'Is it permissible to wear clothing with images of animate beings?',a:'Wearing clothing with images of animate beings (humans, animals) is permissible in general and does not create a religious problem for daily wear. However, for prayer specifically: if the image is of a full-bodied animate creature and is located in a place that is visible/prominent during prayer, it is makruh (discouraged) to pray in such clothing. If the image is small, on the back, or not prominent, the karahah (dislike) is less. Images that are partial (like just a face), very small (like logo designs), or on inner garments are less problematic. This ruling addresses clothing specifically — having images in one\'s house is a separate discussion.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['images','clothing','animate','prayer','permissible']},
{id:'cl007',cat:'clothing',sub:'Hijab',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on wearing hijab in front of mahram men?',a:'In front of mahram men (father, brother, son, uncle, nephew, father-in-law, grandfather, etc.), a woman does not need to observe hijab. She can show her hair and body parts that are normally covered from non-mahrams. However, the awrah that must be covered from everyone (including mahrams) is the area from the navel to the knee. Additionally, it is haram for a woman to show her body to a mahram man with the intention of sexual arousal or if it would cause fitna (corruption), even though hijab itself is not required. General modesty is always recommended even among mahrams.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['hijab','mahram','exemption','women','covering']},
{id:'cl008',cat:'clothing',sub:'Western Clothing',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is wearing Western-style clothing permissible?',a:'Wearing Western-style clothing (suits, jeans, t-shirts, etc.) is permissible as long as it meets Islamic dress code requirements: (1) It covers the awrah appropriately. (2) For men: it does not contain silk or gold. (3) For women: it fulfills hijab requirements (covering hair and body from non-mahrams). (4) It is not specifically the distinctive garment of another religion (like a Christian priest\'s collar or a Jewish kippah worn for religious identification). (5) It is not a garment of the opposite gender (men wearing women\'s specific clothing or vice versa). General modern clothing is not "Western" in the sense of being religiously specific — it is universal and permissible.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['western','clothing','modern','permissible','suit']},
{id:'cl009',cat:'clothing',sub:'Tattoos',marja:'makarem',q:'Is getting a tattoo permissible?',a:'Tattoos (permanent ink under the skin) are permissible in Shia jurisprudence as long as: (1) The tattoo does not depict something haram (obscene images, symbols of kufr). (2) The tattooing process does not cause significant harm to health. (3) It does not prevent water from reaching the skin for wudu/ghusl — since the ink is under the skin, it does not form a barrier, so wudu and ghusl are valid with tattoos. (4) It is not done in areas that would require exposing the awrah to a non-mahram. While permissible, it is generally discouraged by many scholars as unnecessary bodily modification. Temporary henna designs are clearly permissible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tattoo','permissible','wudu','barrier','body']},
{id:'cl010',cat:'clothing',sub:'Prayer',marja:'najafi',q:'Can a woman pray without hijab if she is alone?',a:'Even when praying alone with no one present (including no non-mahram men), a woman must still observe the prayer dress code — covering everything except the face and hands. This covering is a condition of the prayer itself, not just related to the presence of non-mahrams. The prayer hijab includes covering the hair, neck, ears, arms, legs, and body. The covering for prayer is slightly different from hijab outside of prayer: the feet do not need to be covered in prayer if no non-mahram is present (this is a point of scholarly discussion). A woman who prays without proper covering must repeat the prayer.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['prayer','woman','alone','hijab','covering']},
{id:'cl011',cat:'clothing',sub:'Men Dress Code',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the dress code for Muslim men?',a:'Men must cover from the navel to the knees at minimum (awrah). Additional rules: (1) Pure silk garments are haram for men, (2) Gold jewelry (rings, chains, bracelets) is haram for men, (3) Clothing must not be so thin or tight that it reveals the awrah, (4) Cross-dressing (wearing women\'s clothing) is haram, (5) Clothing should not be an expression of arrogance or extravagance. There is no specific requirement for head covering for men, though it is culturally common in some regions. Clean, modest, and dignified clothing is the standard.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['men','clothing','silk','gold','dress code','awrah']},
{id:'cl012',cat:'clothing',sub:'Men Dress Code',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the dress code for Muslim men?',a:'The male dress code emphasizes modesty without the extensive coverage requirements of women. Key prohibitions: silk garments (pure silk — blended fabrics with less than 50% silk are permissible) and gold ornaments. The appearance should be dignified and not attention-seeking. In prayer, the awrah must be covered. The Prophet (s) encouraged: wearing white, keeping clothes clean, and dressing appropriately for different occasions. Clothing should not imitate specifically female attire.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['men','clothing','silk','gold','dress code','awrah']},
{id:'cl013',cat:'clothing',sub:'Men Dress Code',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the dress code for Muslim men?',a:'Men\'s clothing rules: cover the awrah (navel to knee), no pure silk, no gold jewelry. Beyond these specific prohibitions, men have considerable freedom in clothing choices. Suits, casual wear, traditional clothing — all permissible. The emphasis is on: modesty, cleanliness, not imitating the opposite gender, and not being extravagant. A steel or silver ring is permissible and recommended. A watch is perfectly fine even if it has gold-colored parts (as long as it\'s not actual gold).',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['men','clothing','silk','gold','dress code','awrah']},
{id:'cl014',cat:'clothing',sub:'Women Hijab',marja:'sistani',q:'What is required for proper hijab?',a:'The obligatory hijab for women in the presence of non-mahram men requires covering: (1) The entire body except the face (from hairline to chin, ear to ear) and hands (to the wrists). (2) Hair must be completely covered — not a single strand should be visible. (3) The clothing must not be so tight that it reveals body contours. (4) It must not be transparent. (5) It should not be perfumed in the presence of non-mahram men. (6) It should not be attention-grabbing or decorative to the extent that it defeats the purpose of hijab. The feet are debated — covering is obligatory precaution.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hijab','women','covering','modesty','clothing','obligation']},
{id:'cl015',cat:'clothing',sub:'Women Hijab',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is required for proper hijab?',a:'Hijab is a Quranic obligation (24:31, 33:59). The requirements: covering all hair and body except face and hands. The covering should be loose-fitting, non-transparent, and not itself an adornment. The purpose is modesty, not specific clothing style — any outfit meeting these conditions is valid: traditional chador, abaya, or modern modest clothing combinations. The color is not prescribed — black is cultural, not religious. Hijab also includes behavior: modest speech, lowering the gaze, and dignified conduct.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hijab','women','covering','modesty','clothing','obligation']},
{id:'cl016',cat:'clothing',sub:'Women Hijab',marja:'makarem',q:'What is required for proper hijab?',a:'Hijab is both a spiritual and practical concept. Physical requirements: cover hair and body (except face and hands) in front of non-mahram men. The "except face and hands" exemption is based on Quranic interpretation and hadith. Practical guidance: (1) Scarves, wraps, and caps that cover all hair are valid, (2) Long sleeves and loose pants or skirts are acceptable, (3) The outfit as a whole should be modest, (4) Minimal makeup on the face is a matter of scholarly discussion — some scholars permit everyday makeup that is not excessive or provocative. Hijab is about modesty, not uniformity.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['hijab','women','covering','modesty','clothing','obligation']},
{id:'cl017',cat:'clothing',sub:'Prayer Clothing',marja:'sistani',q:'What clothing is required for prayer?',a:'For men in prayer: cover at minimum from navel to knees (though covering the torso is strongly recommended). For women in prayer: cover the entire body including hair, except the face (the circle of the face) and hands to the wrists and feet to the ankles. Conditions for prayer clothing: (1) Must not be usurped/stolen, (2) Must not be made of parts of haram-meat animals, (3) Must not be pure silk (for men), (4) Must not be gold-woven (for men), (5) Must be tahir (clean from najasah) — at least the area of the body in sujud must be tahir.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['prayer','clothing','covering','men','women','conditions']},
{id:'cl018',cat:'clothing',sub:'Prayer Clothing',marja:'khamenei',q:'What clothing is required for prayer?',a:'Prayer clothing rules differ from general modesty rules. In prayer, even if alone, one must cover the awrah. Women must cover everything except the face, hands, and feet (according to many scholars). A woman\'s prayer in her home alone still requires full covering. The clothing must not be from haram sources. Prayer in clothes that are slightly najis (like a small blood spot smaller than a dirham) is valid if one doesn\'t know about it or has no alternative.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['prayer','clothing','covering','men','women','conditions']},

{id:'cl019',cat:'clothing',sub:'Gold',marja:'sistani',q:'Can men wear gold jewelry?',a:'Wearing gold is haram for men — this includes gold rings, necklaces, bracelets, watches with gold cases, cufflinks, and any gold jewelry. Prayer performed while wearing gold is invalid (batil) on obligatory precaution. Gold-plated items where gold is merely coating are also problematic. White gold (which is actually a gold alloy) is haram. Silver rings are recommended for men. Women may wear any amount of gold.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gold','men','jewelry','forbidden','silver']},
{id:'cl020',cat:'clothing',sub:'Gold',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can men wear gold jewelry?',a:'Gold adornment is forbidden for men in Islam. This covers: rings, chains, watches with gold bodies, belt buckles, tie clips, and any decorative gold worn on the body. Gold teeth (fillings, crowns) are an exception when medically necessary. The prohibition is specific to wearing/adorning — owning gold as an investment is permissible. Platinum, silver, and other metals are fine for men.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['gold','men','jewelry','forbidden','silver']},
{id:'cl021',cat:'clothing',sub:'Gold',marja:'makarem',q:'Can men wear gold jewelry?',a:'The prohibition of gold for men is established by numerous authentic hadith. It applies to all items worn for adornment: jewelry, watch cases, eyeglass frames, buttons, and decorative items. Gold dental work is exempted due to medical necessity. The wisdom includes: maintaining gender distinction in appearance, avoiding extravagance, and spiritual discipline. Men should wear silver rings, particularly aqiq (agate/carnelian), which is strongly recommended.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['gold','men','jewelry','forbidden','silver']},
