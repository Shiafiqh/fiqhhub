(2) Dhuhr — 4 rak\'at, from midday to sunset. (3) Asr — 4 rak\'at, from midday to sunset (after Dhuhr). (4) Maghrib — 3 rak\'at, after sunset until midnight. (5) Isha — 4 rak\'at, after sunset until midnight (after Maghrib). The total is 17 rak\'at daily. Each prayer has its specific time, though some can share time windows.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 729',tags:['daily prayers','times','rakat','obligatory']},
{id:'s002',cat:'salat',sub:'Obligatory Prayers',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for prayer to be valid?',a:'The conditions for valid prayer include: (1) Time — prayer must be within its prescribed time. (2) Qiblah — one must face the Ka\'bah. (3) Clothing — must be tahir, not usurped, not made from haram animal parts; for men, must cover from navel to knees; for women, must cover entire body except face and hands. (4) Place — must be tahir where sajdah is performed, must be stable, the place for sajdah must not be significantly higher or lower than feet. (5) Wudu/Ghusl/Tayammum. (6) Intention (niyyah). (7) The person must be of sound mind.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Salat',tags:['prayer','conditions','validity','requirements']},
{id:'s003',cat:'salat',sub:'Qiblah',marja:'sistani',q:'How should one determine the qiblah direction?',a:'One should determine the qiblah direction through: (1) Personal certainty. (2) Testimony of two reliable (adil) persons. (3) A reliable compass or qiblah application that gives confident results. (4) If none of these provide certainty, one should pray in the direction they believe is most likely correct. If no probable direction can be determined, they should pray in four directions as a precaution. In prayer, a minor deviation from the exact qiblah direction is tolerable as long as one is generally facing the correct direction.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 778',tags:['qiblah','direction','compass','determination']},
{id:'s004',cat:'salat',sub:'Qiblah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on praying on an airplane?',a:'Prayer on an airplane is obligatory at its proper time and should not be delayed merely because one is on a plane. If the person can stand and face the qiblah, they must do so. If standing is not possible or causes significant hardship, they may pray sitting. If the plane changes direction during prayer, they should adjust to face the qiblah as much as possible. If determining the exact qiblah is difficult, they should pray in the direction they believe to be most likely correct. Ruku and sujud should be performed as normally as possible, even if only by nodding.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['airplane','travel','qiblah','sitting','prayer']},
{id:'s005',cat:'salat',sub:'Congregational',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on praying behind a Sunni imam in congregation?',a:'It is permissible to pray behind a Sunni imam for maintaining Muslim unity and in situations where a Shia congregation is not available (such as in Masjid al-Haram, Masjid al-Nabawi, or workplaces). The prayer should be performed with one\'s own Shia intention. One should recite al-Hamd and surah themselves silently. The prayer counts as congregation (jama\'ah) and is valid. This is from the principles of taqiyyah and preserving Muslim unity which the Imams (as) emphasized.',source:'al-Fiqh lil-Mughtaribin',tags:['congregation','sunni','unity','taqiyyah','prayer']},
{id:'s006',cat:'salat',sub:'Congregational',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can a woman lead congregational prayer?',a:'A woman can lead congregational prayer for other women only. She cannot lead men in congregational prayer. When leading women, the female imam should stand in the same row as the followers (not ahead of them). She can also lead mixed-gender congregational prayers where all followers are women and there are no male followers. The condition of a male imam is required when men are among the congregation.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['women','imam','congregation','leading','prayer']},
{id:'s007',cat:'salat',sub:'Traveler Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'When must a traveler shorten their prayers (qasr)?',a:'A traveler must shorten 4-rak\'at prayers to 2 rak\'at when: (1) The journey distance is at least 8 farsakh (approximately 44 km / 27 miles) one way. (2) The person intends to travel this distance from the outset. (3) The traveler does not intend to stay in one place for 10 or more days during the journey. (4) The travel is not for sinful purposes. (5) The person is not a professional traveler (someone whose occupation involves constant travel). (6) The person has passed the point of tarakhkhus (where they can no longer hear the adhan of their city). Fajr and Maghrib prayers are not shortened.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1271',tags:['travel','qasr','shortening','distance','prayer']},
{id:'s008',cat:'salat',sub:'Traveler Prayer',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling for someone who regularly commutes between two cities for work?',a:'A person who travels regularly between two cities for work (such as daily or several times a week) is considered a frequent traveler (kathir al-safar). After a period of regularity (approximately 10 trips or the travel becoming their habitual pattern), they should pray full (tamam) prayers during their commute, not qasr. This applies to all regular commuters: teachers, students, businesspeople who regularly travel the same route. If they make a different, non-routine journey, they pray qasr for that trip.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Travel',tags:['commute','frequent traveler','work','qasr','tamam']},
{id:'s009',cat:'salat',sub:'Sajdah',marja:'sistani',q:'What surfaces are valid for sajdah (prostration)?',a:'Sajdah must be performed on earth or things that grow from earth (that are not eaten as food or worn as clothing). Valid surfaces include: soil, sand, stone, clay tablets (turbah), leaves and bark of trees, grass, straw. Invalid surfaces include: food items (wheat, rice, fruit), items of clothing (cotton, linen when in fabric form), synthetic materials, carpet, leather, metal. A turbah (clay tablet, especially from Karbala) is the recommended surface. Wood and paper are permissible for sajdah.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1052',tags:['sajdah','surface','turbah','earth','prostration']},
{id:'s010',cat:'salat',sub:'Sajdah',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is it permissible to prostrate on paper or cardboard?',a:'Yes, prostrating on paper and cardboard is permissible because they are made from wood pulp, which originates from trees — things that grow from the earth and are not eaten as food or worn as clothing. Paper, whether plain or printed, is a valid surface for sajdah. This applies to newspapers, notebooks, cardboard, and similar products. It is a practical alternative when a turbah is not available.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['sajdah','paper','cardboard','prostration']},
{id:'s011',cat:'salat',sub:'Friday Prayer',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is Friday prayer (Salat al-Jumu\'ah) obligatory?',a:'During the occultation of the Twelfth Imam (aj), Friday prayer is wajib takhyiri — meaning it is obligatory as a choice: one can pray either the Friday prayer (2 rak\'at with two khutbahs) or the regular Dhuhr prayer (4 rak\'at). If Friday prayer is established with proper conditions (a just imam leading it, minimum attendance), attending it is highly recommended and if one attends, it replaces the Dhuhr prayer. In the Islamic Republic, Friday prayer is established and strongly recommended.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['friday','jumuah','obligatory','dhuhr','occultation']},
{id:'s012',cat:'salat',sub:'Friday Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on Salat al-Jumu\'ah during the Greater Occultation?',a:'According to obligatory precaution, if Friday prayer is properly established with all its conditions in a locality, one should either attend it or pray Dhuhr. If one attends Friday prayer performed with all conditions, it suffices in place of Dhuhr prayer. The conditions include: a just imam, two khutbahs before the prayer addressing Islamic affairs, and minimum attendance. During the Greater Occultation, its obligatory nature is a matter of precaution rather than definitive obligation.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['friday','jumuah','occultation','precaution']},
{id:'s013',cat:'salat',sub:'Adhan & Iqamah',marja:'sistani',q:'Is adhan and iqamah obligatory before prayer?',a:'Adhan and iqamah before daily obligatory prayers are recommended (mustahab mu\'akkad) — they are not obligatory. However, they are so strongly recommended that abandoning them is highly disliked (makruh). For women, they are also recommended but the recommendation is less emphasized. In congregational prayer, if the adhan and iqamah have already been recited by the mu\'adhin, individual worshippers do not need to recite them again. They are not prescribed for non-daily prayers like Salat al-Ayat.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 918',tags:['adhan','iqamah','recommended','obligatory','prayer']},
{id:'s014',cat:'salat',sub:'Recitation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it obligatory to recite prayers in Arabic?',a:'Yes, the obligatory recitations in prayer must be in Arabic. This includes: al-Fatihah and a second surah in the first two rak\'at, dhikr in ruku and sujud, tashahhud, salam, and takbirat al-ihram. A person who cannot recite Arabic must learn it. If they are unable to learn properly, they should recite as best they can. Supplications (du\'a) and qunut can be in any language, though Arabic is recommended. The qira\'ah must be pronounced correctly — significant mispronunciation that changes meaning invalidates the prayer.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['arabic','recitation','language','pronunciation','prayer']},
{id:'s015',cat:'salat',sub:'Recitation',marja:'makarem',q:'What should a new convert do if they cannot recite Arabic yet?',a:'A new Muslim who has not yet learned Arabic recitation should begin learning immediately. In the meantime, they should pray to the best of their ability, reciting whatever Arabic they have learned and using transliteration aids. If they can recite al-Fatihah even imperfectly, they should do so. For parts they absolutely cannot recite, they may substitute with tasbih (SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illallah, Allahu Akbar). The obligation is to learn gradually — prayer should never be abandoned simply because one cannot recite perfectly yet.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['convert','arabic','learning','recitation','new Muslim']},
{id:'s016',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'sistani',q:'What things invalidate prayer?',a:'Prayer is invalidated by: (1) Any of the wudu invalidators occurring during prayer. (2) Turning away from qiblah. (3) Speaking intentionally (even one word, except for answering salam). (4) Laughing intentionally and audibly. (5) Crying intentionally for worldly matters with sound. (6) Any act that breaks the form of prayer (eating, drinking, folding arms intentionally). (7) Saying "Amin" after al-Fatihah intentionally. (8) Intentionally adding or omitting a rukn (pillar) of prayer. (9) Deliberate doubt in the first two rak\'at of a 4-rak\'at prayer. (10) Facing completely away from qiblah.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1135',tags:['invalidation','prayer','breaking','mubtilat']},
{id:'s017',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to pray while images of living beings are on clothing?',a:'It is a precaution to avoid praying in clothing that bears images of living beings (humans, animals), particularly large or prominent images. However, if the image is small and inconspicuous (such as a small brand logo), or is on a part of the clothing that is not visible during prayer, the prayer is valid. The prohibition is more a matter of recommended precaution (ihtiyat mustahab) for most scholars, and praying in such clothing does not definitively invalidate the prayer according to the stronger opinion.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['images','clothing','prayer','living beings','logo']},
{id:'s018',cat:'salat',sub:'Signs Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'When is Salat al-Ayat (Prayer of Signs) obligatory?',a:'Salat al-Ayat becomes obligatory upon: (1) Solar eclipse — even partial. (2) Lunar eclipse — even partial. (3) Earthquake — even minor ones. (4) Any frightening natural phenomena such as severe storms, unusual thunderbolts, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, or widespread flooding that causes general fear among people. The prayer is obligatory for all residents of the locality where the phenomenon occurs. For eclipses, the prayer must be performed during the event; for earthquakes and other events, it should be performed as soon as possible and remains an obligation until performed.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1491',tags:['ayat','eclipse','earthquake','signs','natural']},
{id:'s019',cat:'salat',sub:'Eid Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'Is Eid prayer obligatory or recommended?',a:'During the Greater Occultation of the Twelfth Imam (aj), Eid prayer (for both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha) is recommended (mustahab) and not individually obligatory. However, it is highly emphasized and attending it is one of the distinctive practices of Islam. It consists of 2 rak\'at with special additional takbirat and qunut. If performed in congregation, it is performed without adhan and iqamah. Some scholars hold that if Friday prayer is established in a city, Eid prayer gains a stronger status.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Eid',tags:['eid','fitr','adha','prayer','recommended']},
{id:'s020',cat:'salat',sub:'Qada Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'Must one make up (qada) missed prayers?',a:'Yes, making up missed obligatory prayers is obligatory. If a person misses any of the five daily prayers — whether intentionally, due to sleep, forgetfulness, or other reasons — they must make them up. There is no specific time for qada prayers; they can be performed at any time. However, one should not delay them unnecessarily. The order between qada prayers should be maintained if known (i.e., if you missed Dhuhr and Asr, pray qada Dhuhr first). A son is obligated, as a precaution, to make up the missed prayers of his deceased father (the eldest son\'s obligation).',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1370',tags:['qada','missed','makeup','prayer','deceased']},
{id:'s021',cat:'salat',sub:'Qada Prayer',marja:'najafi',q:'Is the eldest son obligated to make up his deceased parent\'s missed prayers?',a:'As an obligatory precaution, the eldest son is obligated to make up the missed prayers and fasts of his deceased father. This obligation applies to prayers the father missed due to valid reasons (not those he deliberately abandoned without excuse). If the son cannot perform them himself, he may hire someone to do so on his behalf. This obligation does not apply to the mother\'s missed prayers, though it is recommended. Other sons can voluntarily perform the qada on behalf of the deceased as well.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['eldest son','deceased','father','qada','obligation']},
{id:'s022',cat:'salat',sub:'Congregational',marja:'wahid',q:'What is the minimum distance between the imam and the follower in congregational prayer?',a:'The distance between the person praying and the person in front of them should not exceed one long step (approximately one meter). Similarly, if one is in the same row, the distance between the persons should not exceed this amount. There should be no impenetrable barrier between the imam and the followers. If praying in rows, each row must be connected to the one in front through this proximity. Excessive gaps that break the chain of connection between follower and imam invalidate the congregation for that individual.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['congregation','distance','row','barrier','proximity']},
{id:'s023',cat:'salat',sub:'Traveler Prayer',marja:'sistani',q:'What defines the point of tarakhkhus where a traveler begins qasr prayer?',a:'The point of tarakhkhus is where the traveler has left their city to the extent that they have passed the last houses of the city and reached a point where, as an obligatory precaution, they can neither see the walls of the city nor hear its adhan (assuming normal conditions — not blocked by mountains, etc., and not aided by amplification). At this point, they must begin praying qasr. Upon returning, they resume full prayer when they reach this point again. For modern cities, this is typically when one has exited the municipal boundaries to the point where the city is behind them.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1280',tags:['tarakhkhus','travel','city','boundary','qasr']},
{id:'s024',cat:'salat',sub:'Obligatory Prayers',marja:'hamedani',q:'What is the ruling on delaying prayer until the last minutes of its time?',a:'It is obligatory to perform prayer within its designated time. Deliberately delaying prayer until just before its time expires, though technically valid, is strongly disliked (makruh shadid). The recommended practice is to perform each prayer at the beginning of its time (fadilat time), which has the greatest reward. If one delays without valid reason until the time is about to expire, the prayer is still valid but the person has committed a morally blameworthy act by disregarding the importance of prayer.',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah',tags:['delay','time','early','prayer','fadilat']},
{id:'s025',cat:'salat',sub:'Sajdah',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the seven points of prostration (sajdah)?',a:'In sajdah, seven body parts must be placed on the ground: (1) Forehead. (2) Both palms. (3) Both knees. (4) Both big toes. The forehead must be placed on a valid sajdah surface (earth, turbah, etc.). The other six parts can be placed on any surface. The forehead must be placed on the ground willingly — if it falls involuntarily, that does not count. The seven parts must all be on the ground simultaneously. The place of sajdah should not be more than four joined fingers higher or lower than where the toes are placed.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1052-1063',tags:['sajdah','prostration','seven points','forehead','body']},
{id:'s026',cat:'salat',sub:'Clothing',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a man pray wearing silk clothing?',a:'It is not permissible for men to pray in pure silk clothing. Prayer performed in a garment made entirely of silk is invalid for men. This applies to the outer garments as well as undergarments. If the silk is blended with another material and the silk does not predominate, the clothing is permissible. Women are permitted to wear silk in prayer. Men are also prohibited from wearing gold jewelry during prayer — a gold ring, watch, or chain invalidates a man\'s prayer.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 831',tags:['silk','men','gold','clothing','prayer']},
{id:'s027',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on praying with a tattoo?',a:'Tattoos do not invalidate prayer and do not create a najasah barrier. Since the ink of a tattoo is under the skin, it does not prevent water from reaching the skin during wudu or ghusl. Therefore, wudu and ghusl remain valid, and prayer performed with tattoos is valid. However, the permissibility of getting a tattoo itself is a separate question — the process of tattooing and its content should be evaluated independently. Obscene or anti-Islamic images would be problematic regardless of prayer.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tattoo','prayer','wudu','validity','ink']},
{id:'s028',cat:'salat',sub:'Obligatory Prayers',marja:'tabrizi',q:'What is the ruling on combining Dhuhr and Asr prayers?',a:'It is permissible to pray Dhuhr and Asr consecutively without separation, as well as Maghrib and Isha. While it is recommended (mustahab) to pray each at its specific virtuous time (fadilat), the shared time window means combining them is fully valid. The specific time for Dhuhr is from midday until the time needed for 4 rak\'at has passed; the specific time for Asr is before sunset with enough time for only 4 rak\'at. The shared time between these specific times is valid for either prayer, as long as Dhuhr is prayed first.',source:'Siraat al-Najah',tags:['combining','dhuhr','asr','maghrib','isha','time']},
{id:'s029',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'sistani',q:'Can one pray wearing shoes?',a:'It is permissible to pray wearing shoes or sandals provided that: (1) The shoes are tahir (pure). (2) The shoes are not made from the hide of a haram animal or an animal not slaughtered Islamically. (3) The shoes are not usurped property. (4) For sujud, the big toes must be able to touch the ground. With most modern shoes, this last condition makes it impractical, so shoes are usually removed for prayer. Socks are fine as long as the toes can make contact with the ground during sujud.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['shoes','footwear','prayer','sujud','toes']},
{id:'s030',cat:'salat',sub:'Recommended',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the recommended daily prayers (nawafil)?',a:'The daily recommended (mustahab) prayers are 34 rak\'at: (1) Fajr nafilah — 2 rak\'at before Fajr prayer. (2) Dhuhr nafilah — 8 rak\'at before Dhuhr. (3) Asr nafilah — 8 rak\'at before Asr. (4) Maghrib nafilah — 4 rak\'at after Maghrib. (5) Isha nafilah — 2 rak\'at sitting (counting as 1 rak\'at) after Isha. (6) Salat al-Layl (Tahajjud) — 11 rak\'at in the last part of the night (8 rak\'at nafilah + 2 rak\'at Shaf\' + 1 rak\'ah Witr).

{id:'s031',cat:'salat',sub:'Congregational',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for leading congregational prayer as an imam?',a:'The imam of congregational prayer must be: (1) Baligh (mature). (2) Sane. (3) Ithna Ashari (Twelver Shia). (4) Adil (just/upright — not known to commit major sins or persist in minor ones). (5) Of legitimate birth. (6) Male (when leading men). (7) Able to perform prayer correctly — proper recitation, correct ruku, sujud, etc. (8) If he has a medical condition affecting prayer performance, the followers should not have the same condition. Additionally, the imam\'s prayer must be valid — if he is a traveler praying qasr, residents can follow him and vice versa, but adjustments must be made.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1423',tags:['imam','conditions','congregational','leading']},
{id:'s032',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one pray on a moving train or bus?',a:'If the prayer time will expire before the journey ends and one cannot get off to pray, they must pray on the vehicle. They should face the qiblah and adjust if the vehicle turns. If standing is possible, they should stand; otherwise sitting is permitted. Ruku and sujud should be performed as normally as possible — even by nodding if necessary. If the prayer time is not in danger of expiring, it is better to wait until one can pray normally. For regular commuters whose prayer time frequently falls during travel, the same principles apply.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['train','bus','vehicle','travel','moving','prayer']},
{id:'s033',cat:'salat',sub:'Recitation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it obligatory to recite a full surah after al-Fatihah?',a:'As an obligatory precaution, a complete surah from the Quran must be recited after al-Fatihah in the first two rak\'at of obligatory prayer. The surah should come after al-Fatihah and before ruku. It is not permissible to recite one of the two combined surahs (like al-Fil and Quraysh, or al-Duha and al-Inshirah) alone — if one recites al-Fil, they must also recite Quraysh after it, as they are considered one surah by some scholars. Short surahs like al-Ikhlas, al-Kawthar, or al-Nasr are sufficient.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 973',tags:['surah','recitation','fatihah','obligatory','rak\'at']},
{id:'s034',cat:'salat',sub:'Clothing',marja:'najafi',q:'What are the hijab requirements for women during prayer?',a:'A woman must cover her entire body during prayer except for the face (the area washed in wudu), the hands (from wrist to fingertips), and the feet (from ankle to toes). Hair must be completely covered. The covering does not need to be any specific garment — a chador, scarf with loose clothing, or any combination that covers properly is sufficient. The clothing must not be so thin that skin color shows through. If any part of the body that should be covered becomes exposed during prayer, and the person was unaware, the prayer is valid.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['hijab','women','covering','prayer','clothing']},
{id:'s035',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'hakim',q:'What is the ruling on raising hands for qunut in the second rak\'ah?',a:'Qunut in the second rak\'ah of prayer (before ruku) is recommended (mustahab), not obligatory. The person raises both hands to the level of the face, palms upward, and recites any supplication. There is no specific obligatory supplication for qunut — any du\'a or dhikr is acceptable, even a simple "Rabbighfirli." Qunut is recommended in all obligatory and mustahab prayers. In Friday prayer, there is a qunut in both rak\'at. Omitting qunut does not invalidate the prayer.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['qunut','supplication','second rakat','raising hands']},
{id:'s036',cat:'salat',sub:'Obligatory Prayers',marja:'sistani',q:'How should a person who is physically unable to stand pray?',a:'A person who cannot stand should pray sitting. If they cannot sit, they should pray lying on their right side facing qiblah. If that is not possible, they lie on their left side. If that is not possible, they lie on their back with their feet toward the qiblah. They perform ruku and sujud by nodding — a deeper nod for sujud than for ruku. If even nodding is not possible, they indicate with their eyes (closing them for ruku and sujud). Prayer is never abandoned — it is adapted to whatever the person\'s condition allows.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 970',tags:['disability','sitting','lying','unable to stand','prayer']},
{id:'s037',cat:'salat',sub:'Traveler Prayer',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on prayer for a student studying in another city?',a:'A student who moves to another city for studies and intends to stay there for at least 10 days should pray full (tamam) prayers there. If they settle there for the academic period and adopt it as a temporary residence, they pray full prayers there. When traveling between their university city and hometown, they pray qasr during the journey if the distance exceeds the shar\'i limit. At their hometown (watan), they always pray full prayers. The key criterion is intention of 10-day stay or adoption of the place as a secondary residence.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['student','university','city','qasr','tamam']},
{id:'s038',cat:'salat',sub:'Miscellaneous',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to check the time on a phone during prayer?',a:'It is not permissible to deliberately perform actions during prayer that break its form (such as picking up and looking at a phone). A brief, slight glance to the side would not invalidate prayer, but deliberately looking at a phone, picking it up, or interacting with it constitutes an act that violates the continuity and form of prayer. If one needs to know the time urgently, they should complete or end the prayer first. Phones should be silenced before prayer to avoid disruption.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['phone','time','checking','prayer','invalidation']},
{id:'s039',cat:'salat',sub:'Congregational',marja:'sistani',q:'Is there extra reward for congregational prayer?',a:'Yes, congregational prayer carries immensely greater reward than individual prayer. Narrations from the Ahlulbayt (as) state that a single congregational prayer is equivalent to 25 individual prayers, and some narrations mention even greater multiples. The more people in the congregation, the greater the reward. Congregational prayer for Fajr, Maghrib, and Isha is particularly emphasized.

The obligation is to prostrate on earth or things that grow from earth. A Karbala turbah fulfills this condition and adds the immense spiritual merit of connection to the soil of Imam Hussain\'s (as) martyrdom. If a turbah is not available, one can prostrate on any valid earth surface: clean soil, a rock, a leaf, wood, or paper.

Methods to determine Qibla: (1) Reliable compass or smartphone app, (2) Asking trustworthy local Muslims, (3) Mihrab in established mosques, (4) Scientific calculation based on coordinates. If none available, one must make their best effort — prayer toward the approximate direction is valid. If genuinely unable to determine, pray in all four directions. The degree of precision required is reasonable direction, not exact pinpoint accuracy.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['qibla','direction','compass','prayer','mecca']},
{id:'sl087',cat:'salat',sub:'Qibla',marja:'khamenei',q:'How should one determine the Qibla direction?',a:'Qibla determination can use modern technology — compass apps are valid and reliable. The requirement is to face the general direction of Ka\'bah, not its exact point. In large congregational settings, following the established mosque Qibla is sufficient. If one prays and later discovers the direction was significantly wrong, the prayer should be repeated if still within the prayer time.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['qibla','direction','compass','prayer','mecca']},

{id:'sl089',cat:'salat',sub:'Prayer Times',marja:'sistani',q:'Can prayers be combined?',a:'Yes, it is permissible to combine Dhuhr with Asr (praying them consecutively) and Maghrib with Isha (praying them consecutively). This is one of the distinctive practices in Shia Islam based on authentic hadith. While it is mustahab to pray each at its preferred time, combining is absolutely valid and the Prophet (s) himself combined prayers without travel or rain.
