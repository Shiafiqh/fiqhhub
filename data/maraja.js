        born: 1930,
        birthPlace: 'Mashhad, Iran',

        bio: 'Grand Ayatollah Sistani is widely regarded as the most followed Shia Marja in the world. Born in Mashhad, he moved to Najaf in 1951 to study under the greatest scholars of the hawza. He became a student of Grand Ayatollah al-Khoei, inheriting his rigorous usuli methodology. After al-Khoei\'s passing, Sistani gradually emerged as the leading Marja in Najaf. His jurisprudence is characterized by extreme caution (ihtiyat) and meticulous evidence-based reasoning. He played a pivotal role in Iraq\'s post-2003 political transition, consistently advocating for democratic processes, peaceful resolution, and Iraqi sovereignty. His fatwa in 2014 mobilizing volunteers against ISIS is credited with saving Iraq from collapse.',
        approach: 'Sistani follows a cautious, evidence-based methodology rooted in the school of al-Khoei. He emphasizes careful examination of hadith chains (rijal), gives significant weight to the apparent meaning of Quranic verses, and frequently applies obligatory precaution (ihtiyat wajib) where evidence is ambiguous. His fatwas are known for their precision and for often providing multiple options to the mukallaf. He distinguishes carefully between binding obligation and recommended precaution.'

        followers: 'Iran, Lebanon (significant Hezbollah following), parts of Iraq, Afghanistan, Central Asia',
        bio: 'Grand Ayatollah Khamenei serves as the Supreme Leader of Iran and is simultaneously one of the most followed Maraja among Shia Muslims globally. He studied in Qom and Najaf under luminaries including Imam Khomeini and Allamah Tabatabai. His jurisprudence reflects a unique synthesis of classical fiqh with contemporary governance theory, particularly the concept of Wilayat al-Faqih (Guardianship of the Jurist). He was appointed Supreme Leader in 1989 following Khomeini\'s passing. His rulings often address state-level concerns including defense, economics, and international relations alongside personal fiqh.',
        approach: 'Khamenei\'s jurisprudence integrates Wilayat al-Faqih (Guardianship of the Jurist) into practical rulings. He emphasizes the role of Islamic governance in implementing shari\'ah and considers maslahat (public interest) as a legitimate jurisprudential principle when guided by qualified authority. His fatwas tend to be practical and forward-looking, often addressing modern challenges directly. He is generally less inclined toward ihtiyat wajib than Sistani, preferring to give definitive rulings where possible.'

        bio: 'Grand Ayatollah Shirazi comes from one of the most distinguished scholarly families in Shia history. His brother, the late Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Shirazi, was known for advocating shura (consultation) among jurists and expanding Hussaini rituals globally. Sayyid Sadiq continued this legacy, emphasizing the centrality of mourning for Imam Hussain (as) and the propagation of Ahlulbayt teachings. His family\'s scholarly output exceeds 1,000 published works across multiple generations. He is particularly known for his traditional approach and strong emphasis on cultural and ritual aspects of Shia identity.',
        approach: 'Shirazi follows a traditional jurisprudential methodology that emphasizes hadith-centered reasoning and the preservation of Shia ritual traditions. He gives particular weight to narrations from Ahlulbayt (as) and tends toward permissibility in matters of Hussaini mourning practices. His approach to modern issues is conservative, rooted in classical texts, though he engages with contemporary questions. He advocates for shura (consultation) among Maraja rather than centralized religious authority.'

His approach is characterized by accessibility — he strives to make rulings clear and understandable to ordinary Muslims. He is methodical in deriving rulings, often providing extensive Quranic evidence.
