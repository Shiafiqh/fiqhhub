{id:'f001',cat:'food',sub:'Meat',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for meat to be halal?',a:'For meat to be halal: (1) The animal must be from a halal species (cattle, sheep, goat, chicken, camel, deer, rabbit, etc.). (2) It must be slaughtered by a Muslim (or, for some scholars, an Ahlul Kitab person with conditions). (3) The slaughterer must say "Bismillah" (In the name of Allah) at the time of slaughter. (4) The animal must be facing the qiblah during slaughter. (5) The four main vessels in the neck (windpipe, esophagus, and two jugular veins) must be cut with a sharp instrument. (6) The animal must show signs of life at the time of slaughter. (7) The blood must be allowed to flow out normally. Machine slaughter is acceptable if these conditions are maintained.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2, Foods',tags:['meat','halal','slaughter','conditions','dhabiha']},
{id:'f002',cat:'food',sub:'Seafood',marja:'sistani',q:'What types of seafood are halal in Shia Islam?',a:'In Shia jurisprudence, only fish with scales are halal from sea creatures. This includes: salmon, tuna, cod, bass, trout, sardines, mackerel, herring, tilapia, and similar scaled fish. The following are NOT halal: shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, mussels, clams), catfish (no scales), shark, eel, octopus, squid, whale, dolphin, frog, turtle, and any sea creature without scales. Shrimp is specifically halal according to Ayatollah Sistani and many Shia scholars, as there is a specific narration permitting it. Caviar from halal fish is permissible. The fish must be caught alive from water or die in the fishing net — fish found dead floating are not halal.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2',tags:['seafood','fish','scales','shrimp','halal','haram']},
{id:'f003',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is cooking with alcohol permissible if it evaporates?',a:'Cooking with alcoholic beverages (wine, beer, spirits) is not permissible, even if the alcohol evaporates during cooking. The prohibition is on the substance itself — wine (khamr) and alcoholic beverages are najis according to many scholars, and cooking with them does not purify them or make the food halal. The fact that alcohol may evaporate does not change the ruling. However, naturally occurring trace amounts of alcohol in foods like bread (from yeast fermentation), vinegar, or ripe fruits are not prohibited as these are not intoxicating beverages. The prohibition specifically targets intoxicating drinks and substances.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['alcohol','cooking','evaporation','wine','haram']},
{id:'f004',cat:'food',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'makarem',q:'Is gelatin from non-halal sources permissible?',a:'Gelatin derived from non-halal animal sources (pork, or animals not slaughtered Islamically) is a subject of scholarly debate regarding istihalah (transformation). If the manufacturing process constitutes a complete chemical transformation (istihalah) where the original substance has fundamentally changed its nature, some scholars consider the resulting gelatin tahir and permissible. However, many scholars maintain that gelatin from haram sources is not permissible because the transformation is not complete — it retains the properties of the original substance. As a precaution, it is better to use plant-based gelatin, halal-certified gelatin, or fish gelatin. If there is genuine doubt, avoid it.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gelatin','istihalah','haram','transformation','pork']},
{id:'f005',cat:'food',sub:'Meat',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to eat at non-Muslim restaurants?',a:'Eating at non-Muslim restaurants is permissible for vegetarian/vegan dishes and non-meat items (bread, rice, vegetables, dairy) as long as they are not contaminated with najis substances and are not cooked with alcohol. For meat: one can eat the meat only if certain it was slaughtered according to Islamic requirements (halal certified). Meat from non-Muslim sources where the method of slaughter is unknown is not permissible. Fish (with scales) served at non-Muslim restaurants is halal if one can verify it is a halal species and was not contaminated with haram items. The utensils of non-Muslims are considered tahir unless known to be najis.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['restaurant','non-Muslim','eating','halal','meat']},
{id:'f006',cat:'food',sub:'Additives',marja:'shirazi',q:'What is the ruling on food additives and E-numbers?',a:'Each food additive must be evaluated individually: (1) Plant-based or synthetic additives are generally halal. (2) Additives derived from halal animal sources (halal-slaughtered) are permissible. (3) Additives from haram animals (pork-derived) are haram unless genuine istihalah has occurred. Common concerns: E120 (cochineal — from insects, haram for some), E441 (gelatin — check source), E471 (mono-diglycerides — check if plant or animal derived), E542 (bone phosphate — animal derived). When in doubt, it is recommended to choose products with halal certification. If the source is genuinely unknown and cannot be determined, some scholars permit consumption based on the principle of original permissibility.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['additives','e-numbers','halal','ingredients','haram']},
{id:'f007',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol',marja:'sistani',q:'Is non-alcoholic beer permissible?',a:'Non-alcoholic beer that contains 0.0% alcohol is permissible to drink. If the beverage contains a trace amount of alcohol (0.5% or less) that is: (a) not intoxicating even in large quantities, and (b) naturally present due to the manufacturing process — many scholars permit it, as this trace amount exists naturally in many foods. However, if the beverage was produced as an alcoholic drink and then had its alcohol removed, some scholars apply precaution and consider it better to avoid. The determining factor is whether the drink is classified as an intoxicant (muskir) — if it cannot intoxicate even in large amounts, it is permissible.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['non-alcoholic','beer','permissible','alcohol','muskir']},
{id:'f008',cat:'food',sub:'Meat',marja:'wahid',q:'Is stunned meat (pre-slaughter stunning) halal?',a:'Pre-slaughter stunning is a point of scholarly discussion. The condition for halal meat is that the animal must be alive at the time of slaughter and the blood must flow normally. If the stunning method merely renders the animal unconscious but it is still alive (heart beating, blood flowing) when the Islamic slaughter is performed with all conditions (bismillah, qiblah, Muslim slaughterer, cutting the vessels), then the meat is halal. However, if the stunning kills the animal before slaughter, or is so severe that the animal would die regardless, the meat is not halal. Electrical stunning that does not kill is generally accepted; captive bolt stunning that may kill is problematic.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['stunning','slaughter','halal','alive','electrical']},
{id:'f009',cat:'food',sub:'Cheese',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is cheese made with animal rennet halal?',a:'Cheese made with rennet from a non-halal source (animal not slaughtered Islamically) is a matter of debate. The rennet itself, being from the stomach of a dead (non-halal) animal, would normally be najis. However, if the rennet has undergone istihalah (complete transformation) in the cheese-making process, some scholars consider it permissible. Many contemporary scholars advise: if the cheese is from Muslim-majority countries with halal slaughter, it is fine. From non-Muslim countries, use vegetarian rennet cheeses or those certified halal. Microbial rennet (lab-produced) is always halal.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['cheese','rennet','halal','istihalah','vegetarian']},
{id:'f010',cat:'food',sub:'General',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on genetically modified (GM) food?',a:'Genetically modified food is permissible unless it contains genes from haram animals (e.g., pig genes inserted into a crop). The general principle is that the original ruling of permissibility (ibahah) applies to foods unless a specific prohibition exists. Genetic modification using plant genes or bacterial genes does not change the halal status of the food. However, if animal genes from haram species were used in a way that the gene product is present in the food, scholars would evaluate whether istihalah has occurred. In practice, most GM crops use bacterial or plant genes, and their consumption is permissible.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['gmo','genetic','modified','food','halal','permissible']},
{id:'f011',cat:'food',sub:'Meat',marja:'najafi',q:'What is the ruling on hunting for food?',a:'Hunting is permissible under specific conditions: (1) Hunting with weapons (gun, arrow, spear): the hunter must be Muslim, must say "Bismillah" before firing/releasing, and the weapon must be sharp enough to penetrate. If the animal is found dead after the shot, it is halal if these conditions were met. If found alive, it must be slaughtered properly. (2) Hunting with a trained dog: the dog must be trained for hunting, the hunter says "Bismillah" when releasing the dog, and the dog must have killed (not just caught) the animal. Hunting with untrained dogs is not sufficient. (3) Fishing by any method is acceptable if the fish has scales and is caught alive.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['hunting','food','conditions','weapon','dog']},
{id:'f012',cat:'food',sub:'General',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to eat food prepared by non-Muslims?',a:'Food prepared by non-Muslims is permissible to eat as long as: (1) The ingredients are halal (no pork, no alcohol, no haram meat). (2) The food is not known to be najis. (3) The utensils are considered tahir (utensils of Ahlul Kitab and others are tahir unless known to have been made najis). For meat specifically, one must ensure it is halal-slaughtered — merely being told "it\'s halal" by a non-Muslim is not sufficient proof. Vegetable dishes, grains, dairy, and other non-meat foods prepared by non-Muslims are generally fine. When invited to a non-Muslim\'s home, it is permissible to eat the non-meat items offered.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['non-Muslim','food','prepared','utensils','halal']},
{id:'f013',cat:'food',sub:'Smoking',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on smoking cigarettes?',a:'Smoking is haram if it causes significant harm to health, and contemporary medical evidence clearly establishes that smoking causes severe harm (cancer, heart disease, etc.). Therefore, for someone who has not started, beginning to smoke is haram. For current smokers, it is obligatory to quit. This ruling is based on the principle that harming oneself is prohibited in Islam. Narrations state that Allah did not make healing in anything He prohibited. The same applies to shisha/hookah, cigars, and other tobacco products. Vaping/e-cigarettes are also subject to this ruling if they cause significant health harm.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['smoking','haram','health','cigarettes','harm']},
{id:'f014',cat:'food',sub:'Drugs',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on recreational drug use?',a:'All recreational drugs that cause intoxication or significant harm to the body or mind are haram. This includes marijuana (when used recreationally), cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ecstasy, LSD, and all similar substances. The prohibition is based on multiple principles: (1) Intoxicants (muskir) are haram by explicit narration. (2) Substances that cause loss of reason are prohibited. (3) Self-harm is prohibited. (4) The Quran prohibits khamr and anything that falls under its category. Medical use of certain controlled substances under doctor supervision for legitimate medical conditions is a separate category and may be permissible when no alternative exists.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['drugs','recreational','haram','intoxicant','marijuana']},
{id:'fd015',cat:'food',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to eat meat from non-Muslim countries?',a:'Meat from non-Muslim countries is not halal unless: (1) It is confirmed to have been slaughtered according to Islamic requirements (Muslim slaughterer, Bismillah, Qiblah direction, etc.), or (2) It comes from a Muslim-owned business that performs halal slaughter. Simply labeling meat as "halal" is insufficient — one must have reasonable confidence in the certification. Meat from restaurants and supermarkets in non-Muslim countries is presumed non-halal unless verified. Fish with scales does not require Islamic slaughter and is halal from any source.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['halal','meat','non-muslim','countries','certification','slaughter']},
{id:'fd016',cat:'food',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to eat meat from non-Muslim countries?',a:'The default for meat in non-Muslim markets is that it is not halal. However, if the meat is from a Muslim country or has reliable halal certification from a trustworthy authority, it may be consumed. The person should investigate the certification body — not all "halal" labels are reliable. In cases of genuine necessity (no halal meat available and health requires meat), some scholars permit a degree of leniency, but this is exceptional.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['halal','meat','non-muslim','countries','certification','slaughter']},
{id:'fd017',cat:'food',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to eat meat from non-Muslim countries?',a:'Practical guidance for Muslims in non-Muslim countries: (1) Find local halal butchers — most major cities have them. (2) Check online for halal certification databases. (3) When dining out, choose seafood (scaled fish) or vegetarian options when halal meat is uncertain. (4) Islamic centers often can direct you to reliable halal sources. (5) Kosher meat is NOT automatically halal in Shia fiqh — the slaughter requirements differ. (6) If you are invited to a non-Muslim home, politely explain your dietary requirements.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['halal','meat','non-muslim','countries','certification','slaughter']},
{id:'fd018',cat:'food',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is it permissible to eat meat from non-Muslim countries?',a:'The conditions for halal meat are strict and must be verified. In non-Muslim countries, Muslims should establish reliable halal supply chains. Community-organized halal slaughter (buying animals directly and having them slaughtered by a Muslim under proper conditions) is the most reliable method. Imported meat from Muslim countries with known halal standards (like certain Australian halal-certified exports) can be acceptable.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['halal','meat','non-muslim','countries','certification','slaughter']},
{id:'fd019',cat:'food',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'sistani',q:'Is gelatin permissible?',a:'Gelatin derived from halal-slaughtered animals is halal. Gelatin from non-halal sources (pork, non-halally slaughtered cattle) is haram UNLESS it has undergone true istihalah (complete chemical transformation) — this is a matter of scholarly debate. Many scholars hold that the industrial processing of gelatin constitutes sufficient transformation, while others maintain it remains haram. On the basis of obligatory precaution, avoid gelatin from non-halal sources unless one\'s marja explicitly permits it.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gelatin','halal','haram','istihalah','pork','transformation']},
{id:'fd020',cat:'food',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is gelatin permissible?',a:'The gelatin question depends on whether industrial processing constitutes istihalah. The bone and skin from which gelatin is derived undergo significant chemical change. Some scholars accept this as transformation, making the product tahir and halal. Others are cautious. The practical advice: use plant-based gelatin alternatives when available (agar-agar, carrageenan). When unavoidable (medicines in gelatin capsules), consult your marja.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['gelatin','halal','haram','istihalah','pork','transformation']},
{id:'fd021',cat:'food',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'makarem',q:'Is gelatin permissible?',a:'Gelatin is a common concern for Muslims in the West — it appears in gummy candies, marshmallows, yogurt, and medicine capsules. If derived from pork: haram according to virtually all scholars. If from cattle: depends on whether the cattle was slaughtered halally and whether processing constitutes transformation. To be safe: choose products labeled "vegetable gelatin" or "kosher gelatin" (which avoids pork), or seek halal-certified products. Gelatin in essential medicines is permitted if no alternative exists.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['gelatin','halal','haram','istihalah','pork','transformation']},
{id:'fd022',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol in Food',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to eat food cooked with alcohol (wine, beer)?',a:'Food cooked with alcoholic beverages (wine, beer, spirits) is haram, even if the alcohol "burns off" during cooking. The substance was originally an intoxicant and najis. Even if the physical alcohol evaporates, the food was prepared with a haram and najis ingredient, which affects the entire dish. This includes sauces (like wine reduction), desserts (like rum cake), and any recipe using alcoholic beverages as an ingredient.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['alcohol','cooking','wine','food','haram','ingredients']},
{id:'fd023',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol in Food',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to eat food cooked with alcohol (wine, beer)?',a:'Cooking with wine, beer, or spirits renders the entire dish haram. The common claim that "alcohol cooks off" doesn\'t change the ruling — the haram ingredient was used, and traces remain. At restaurants, ask about ingredients, especially in sauces, marinades, and desserts. Many fine dining recipes use wine — always inquire. Non-alcoholic wine and beer are a separate discussion and depend on whether they contain any actual alcohol content.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['alcohol','cooking','wine','food','haram','ingredients']},
{id:'fd024',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol in Food',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to eat food cooked with alcohol (wine, beer)?',a:'Foods prepared with alcohol are haram regardless of whether the alcohol evaporates. This applies to: wine sauces, beer-battered foods, desserts with liquor, fondue with wine, and any recipe listing an alcoholic beverage as an ingredient. Vanilla extract containing alcohol is debated — some scholars permit it in tiny amounts used in baking, while others recommend alcohol-free vanilla. When in doubt, avoid or use alternatives.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['alcohol','cooking','wine','food','haram','ingredients']},
{id:'fd025',cat:'food',sub:'Cheese',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on cheese from non-Muslim sources?',a:'Cheese is halal if: (1) It does not contain haram animal rennet (rennet from non-halally slaughtered animals is najis according to some views), (2) No haram ingredients are added. Most modern cheese uses microbial rennet (halal) or vegetable rennet (halal). Traditional cheese using animal rennet from non-halal sources is problematic. However, if the rennet has undergone complete transformation (istihalah) in the cheese-making process, some scholars consider it permissible. Check labels for "microbial enzymes" or "vegetable rennet" — these are always halal.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['cheese','rennet','halal','vegetarian','enzymes','food']},
{id:'fd026',cat:'food',sub:'Cheese',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on cheese from non-Muslim sources?',a:'Most commercially produced cheese is halal — modern cheese production predominantly uses microbial or synthetic rennet rather than animal-derived rennet. When in doubt, look for cheeses labeled as "vegetarian" (which means no animal rennet) or specifically halal-certified. Cheese from known halal producers is preferable. The tiny amount of rennet used and the chemical transformation it undergoes during cheese-making leads many scholars to be lenient.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['cheese','rennet','halal','vegetarian','enzymes','food']},
{id:'fd027',cat:'food',sub:'Cheese',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on cheese from non-Muslim sources?',a:'Cheese is generally permissible in modern production. The historical concern about animal rennet is largely resolved by modern manufacturing practices. Practical advice: look for "suitable for vegetarians" on cheese packaging — this guarantees no animal rennet. Parmesan and some traditional European cheeses still use animal rennet — avoid these unless halal-certified. Mozzarella, cheddar, and most supermarket cheeses use microbial rennet and are fine.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['cheese','rennet','halal','vegetarian','enzymes','food']},
{id:'fd028',cat:'food',sub:'Seafood',marja:'sistani',q:'Are prawns and lobster halal?',a:'Among seafood, only scaled fish and shrimp/prawns are halal in Shia jurisprudence. Prawns are classified with shrimp and are therefore halal. Lobster is NOT halal — it is not a fish and does not have scales. Similarly haram: crab, octopus, squid, oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, eel, catfish (no visible scales), and other non-scaled sea creatures. This ruling is based on specific hadith from the Imams (as) of the Ahlul Bayt.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['seafood','prawns','lobster','halal','haram','shrimp','fish']},
{id:'fd029',cat:'food',sub:'Seafood',marja:'khamenei',q:'Are prawns and lobster halal?',a:'Shrimp and prawns are halal. Lobster, crab, and other crustaceans (except shrimp) are haram. The principle: from sea creatures, only fish with visible scales and shrimp are permitted. This is distinctly different from Sunni jurisprudence, which generally permits all seafood. The Shia position is based on authentic narrations from Imam Baqir (as) and Imam Sadiq (as) specifically limiting halal seafood to scaled fish and shrimp.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['seafood','prawns','lobster','halal','haram','shrimp','fish']},
{id:'fd030',cat:'food',sub:'Seafood',marja:'makarem',q:'Are prawns and lobster halal?',a:'Quick seafood guide: HALAL: salmon, tuna, trout, cod, sardines, herring, mackerel, tilapia, bass, perch, shrimp, prawns. HARAM: lobster, crab, octopus, squid, oysters, clams, mussels, frog legs, turtle, alligator, catfish, shark, swordfish (debated — depends on scale classification), eel. When eating at a seafood restaurant, stick to the clearly halal fish species. Sushi with scaled fish is fine; avoid unagi (eel) and tako (octopus).',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['seafood','prawns','lobster','halal','haram','shrimp','fish']},

{id:'fd031',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol',marja:'sistani',q:'Why is alcohol absolutely forbidden?',a:'Alcohol (khamr) is forbidden by clear Quranic text (5:90), consensus of all Muslim scholars, and abundant hadith. Reasons include: it impairs reason (the most precious human faculty), leads to sin and violence, causes addiction, destroys families, harms health, and wastes resources. Even small amounts are haram — "what intoxicates in large amounts is haram in small amounts." Cooking with alcohol is also haram as the essence remains. Non-alcoholic beer (0.0%) is permissible if it is confirmed truly alcohol-free.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['alcohol','khamr','forbidden','haram','intoxicant']},
{id:'fd032',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol',marja:'khamenei',q:'Why is alcohol absolutely forbidden?',a:'The prohibition of alcohol is one of the most definitive rulings in Islam — there is zero scholarly disagreement. It is haram to: drink, sell, buy, produce, serve, transport, or even sit at a table where alcohol is being consumed (on obligatory precaution for the latter). Foods and medications containing alcohol as an ingredient are generally haram, with limited medical exceptions when no alternative exists. Alcohol-based perfumes are a separate discussion — their external use is debated.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['alcohol','khamr','forbidden','haram','intoxicant']},
{id:'fd033',cat:'food',sub:'Alcohol',marja:'makarem',q:'Why is alcohol absolutely forbidden?',a:'Alcohol is haram in consumption, trade, and production. The Quran explicitly calls it "filth from the work of Satan" (5:90). Medical use of alcohol (as a disinfectant, in medications with no alternative) is permissible under necessity. Alcohol in food flavoring (vanilla extract, wine reduction) is haram to consume. Muslims working in food service should avoid directly serving alcohol where possible. Non-alcoholic alternatives should always be sought.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['alcohol','khamr','forbidden','haram','intoxicant']},
{id:'fd034',cat:'food',sub:'Vegetarianism',marja:'sistani',q:'Is vegetarianism encouraged or discouraged in Islam?',a:'Vegetarianism is permissible — there is no obligation to eat meat in Islam. One may choose a vegetarian or vegan diet for health, ethical, or environmental reasons. However, it is not permissible to declare halal meat as haram — that would be changing Allah\'s ruling. Islam permits meat consumption but does not require it. The Prophet (s) ate meat occasionally, not daily. A balanced diet following the principle of moderation is the Islamic ideal.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['vegetarianism','diet','meat','permissible','choice']},
{id:'fd035',cat:'food',sub:'Vegetarianism',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is vegetarianism encouraged or discouraged in Islam?',a:'A person may choose not to eat meat for personal reasons — this is their right. Islam neither mandates nor prohibits vegetarianism. What is important is: (1) Do not declare halal food as haram, (2) Do not consider vegetarianism as morally superior in a religious sense, (3) Maintain nutritional health. On occasions like Eid al-Adha, the sacrifice is an obligation for those who can afford it, but one may give the meat to others.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['vegetarianism','diet','meat','permissible','choice']},
{id:'fd036',cat:'food',sub:'Vegetarianism',marja:'makarem',q:'Is vegetarianism encouraged or discouraged in Islam?',a:'Vegetarianism is a personal dietary choice that Islam respects. The Quran mentions meat as a blessing but also emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and grains as divine provisions. Many great Islamic scholars maintained simple diets with minimal meat. The key principle: eat halal, eat in moderation, and maintain health. Avoiding meat for ethical concerns about modern factory farming has legitimate grounds in Islamic animal welfare principles.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['vegetarianism','diet','meat','permissible','choice']},

{id:'fd037',cat:'food',sub:'Food Additives',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on food additives with uncertain origins?',a:'If the origin of a food additive is unknown (could be animal or plant derived), it is treated as tahir and halal by default — the principle of istishab al-taharah (presumption of purity) applies. One is not obligated to investigate the source of every ingredient. However, if one KNOWS the additive is from a haram source, it becomes haram. In practice: reading labels for obvious haram ingredients is advisable, but excessive investigation into every E-number is not required.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['additives','food','ingredients','uncertain','halal','permissible']},
{id:'fd038',cat:'food',sub:'Food Additives',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on food additives with uncertain origins?',a:'The default ruling for substances of unknown origin is permissibility (asalat al-hilliyah). Unless one has certain knowledge that an ingredient is haram, it is permissible to consume. This practical principle prevents excessive difficulty (haraj) in daily life. Food purchased from markets in Muslim countries has an additional presumption of permissibility.

{id:'fd039',cat:'food',sub:'Food Additives',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on food additives with uncertain origins?',a:'Islam applies practical principles: uncertain ingredients are treated as halal until proven otherwise. One need not investigate every chemical additive in processed foods. If a reliable Muslim or halal certification body confirms a product, that is sufficient. The key items to avoid are clear: pork products, alcohol, and meat from non-halal slaughter. For everything else, the default is permissibility.
