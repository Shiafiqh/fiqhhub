{id:'ms001',cat:'misc',sub:'Smoking & Vaping',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on smoking cigarettes?',a:'If smoking causes significant harm to health (as medical science has established), it is haram on the basis of the prohibition against harming oneself. For those who are addicted, quitting is obligatory and they should use available means to stop. Starting to smoke when one has never smoked is haram. The ruling applies to all tobacco products. Vaping and e-cigarettes are evaluated similarly — if harmful, they are prohibited.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['smoking','cigarettes','vaping','haram','health']},
{id:'ms002',cat:'misc',sub:'Smoking & Vaping',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on smoking cigarettes?',a:'Smoking is haram due to its proven health harms. This is a clear fatwa. Starting to smoke is absolutely prohibited. Those already addicted must make serious efforts to quit. Vaping is treated the same as smoking regarding health assessment. Hookah/shisha is similarly prohibited. The principle: whatever medical science definitively proves harmful to the body is haram.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['smoking','cigarettes','vaping','haram','health']},
{id:'ms003',cat:'misc',sub:'Smoking & Vaping',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on smoking cigarettes?',a:'Smoking is haram based on the principle of "la darar wa la dirar" (no harm and no causing harm). This includes: cigarettes, cigars, hookah, chewing tobacco, and e-cigarettes if harmful. The social harms (secondhand smoke, financial waste, setting bad example) add to the prohibition. Spending money on cigarettes when it could be used for family needs is additionally problematic.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['smoking','cigarettes','vaping','haram','health']},
{id:'ms004',cat:'misc',sub:'Tattoos',marja:'sistani',q:'Are tattoos permissible in Islam?',a:'Getting a tattoo is not intrinsically haram in Shia fiqh. However, conditions apply: (1) It must not prevent water from reaching the skin during wudu/ghusl — if the tattoo is under the skin (as modern tattoos are), it does not create a barrier and wudu is valid. (2) The image must not be haram content, (3) The process must not involve significant harm. Note: this differs from the Sunni position which generally considers tattoos haram.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tattoo','wudu','skin','permissible','body']},
{id:'ms005',cat:'misc',sub:'Tattoos',marja:'khamenei',q:'Are tattoos permissible in Islam?',a:'Tattoos that are injected under the skin (most modern tattoos) do not prevent water reaching the skin, so wudu and ghusl remain valid. Getting a tattoo is permissible if: the content is not haram (no inappropriate images), it doesn\'t involve excessive harm, and it\'s not of religious symbols that would be disrespected. However, it is makruh (discouraged) in general.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['tattoo','wudu','skin','permissible','body']},
{id:'ms006',cat:'misc',sub:'Tattoos',marja:'makarem',q:'Are tattoos permissible in Islam?',a:'Modern tattoos (where ink is deposited under the skin layer) do not invalidate wudu as water still reaches the skin surface. The permissibility depends on: (1) content — Islamic, decent content is fine; haram imagery is forbidden, (2) the process — if it involves significant pain or health risk beyond normal, it\'s problematic, (3) social perception — if it leads to negative assumptions about the person\'s faith, caution is advised.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['tattoo','wudu','skin','permissible','body']},
{id:'ms007',cat:'misc',sub:'Pets',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rulings on keeping pets?',a:'Keeping pets is generally permissible with conditions: (1) Dogs — their saliva and wet body are najis. Keeping dogs indoors is makruh except for guarding, herding, or other legitimate purposes. (2) Cats — fully tahir (pure), and the Prophet (s) was known to love cats. (3) Birds, fish, rabbits — permissible. (4) All pets must be properly fed and cared for — neglecting an animal is sinful. (5) Money spent on pets should not be excessive when there are greater obligations unfulfilled.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['pets','dogs','cats','animals','najis','permissible']},
{id:'ms008',cat:'misc',sub:'Pets',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rulings on keeping pets?',a:'Keeping animals requires proper care — Islam takes animal rights seriously. Dogs are najis in body moisture but keeping them for security, herding, hunting, or assistance (guide dogs) is permissible. Cats are encouraged — they are tahir and beloved in Islamic tradition. Fish, birds, and other clean animals make good pets. Animal cruelty in any form is haram.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['pets','dogs','cats','animals','najis','permissible']},
{id:'ms009',cat:'misc',sub:'Pets',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rulings on keeping pets?',a:'The key principle is responsible pet ownership. Islam requires: adequate food and water, proper shelter, veterinary care when needed, and not causing the animal distress. Keeping exotic animals that belong in the wild is discouraged. The animal\'s welfare must be genuinely considered. Imam Sadiq (as) narrated that a woman entered hellfire for starving a cat — showing how seriously Islam takes animal welfare.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['pets','dogs','cats','animals','najis','permissible']},
{id:'ms010',cat:'misc',sub:'Organ Donation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is organ donation permissible?',a:'Organ donation is permissible if: (1) It saves a life or significantly improves quality of life, (2) The donor consents (or their family for deceased donors), (3) For living donors — the donation must not cause death or serious harm, (4) For deceased donors — death must be medically confirmed. The principle of saving life (which is likened in Quran to saving all humanity) supports organ donation. It is actually recommended when it saves lives.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['organ','donation','transplant','life','saving']},
{id:'ms011',cat:'misc',sub:'Organ Donation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is organ donation permissible?',a:'Organ donation from deceased persons is permissible and can be meritorious if it saves lives. Living donation is permissible for renewable organs/tissues (blood, bone marrow) and for non-vital organs (one kidney) if the risk is acceptable. Selling organs is problematic — donation should be voluntary. Brain death as a criterion for organ harvesting is accepted by most contemporary scholars.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['organ','donation','transplant','life','saving']},
{id:'ms012',cat:'misc',sub:'Organ Donation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is organ donation permissible?',a:'Organ donation is one of the greatest acts of charity. The Quran says: "Whoever saves a life, it is as if they saved all of humanity" (5:32). Both living and posthumous donation are permissible. The donor or their family must consent. Commercial organ trade is prohibited to protect the vulnerable. Blood donation is highly encouraged.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['organ','donation','transplant','life','saving']},
{id:'ms013',cat:'misc',sub:'Photography',marja:'sistani',q:'Is photography and video permissible?',a:'Photography and video are permissible. The prohibition in some classical texts related to sculpting three-dimensional idols (taswir), which was connected to idol worship. Modern photography, video, and digital imaging are different in nature and are halal. Conditions: (1) The content must not be haram (inappropriate images), (2) Photography of non-mahram should respect hijab norms, (3) Using images for deception is haram.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['photography','video','images','permissible','taswir']},
{id:'ms014',cat:'misc',sub:'Photography',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is photography and video permissible?',a:'Photography, filmmaking, and digital media are halal tools. They can be used for education, documentation, art, and communication. The earlier scholarly discussions about taswir concerned physical statues used in worship. Modern visual media serves legitimate purposes. Content standards apply — the medium is neutral; the content determines the ruling.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['photography','video','images','permissible','taswir']},
{id:'ms015',cat:'misc',sub:'Photography',marja:'makarem',q:'Is photography and video permissible?',a:'Photography and video are permissible and can be means of great good — documenting knowledge, preserving history, education, and communication. The rulings about taswir in hadith were about idol-making, not modern imaging. Using photography for haram purposes (spreading indecent content) is what makes specific uses forbidden, not the technology itself.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['photography','video','images','permissible','taswir']},
{id:'ms016',cat:'misc',sub:'Gambling',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on gambling and lottery?',a:'Gambling in all forms is haram — the Quran explicitly prohibits it (5:90-91). This includes: casino gambling, sports betting, poker for money, lottery tickets, scratch cards, and any game where money is wagered on uncertain outcomes. Online gambling is the same ruling. Prizes from competitions based on skill (not chance) are halal. Raffles where a ticket is purchased for a chance to win are debated — if the ticket price includes a charitable donation and the chance of winning is secondary, some scholars show flexibility.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gambling','lottery','haram','betting','prohibited','games']},
{id:'ms017',cat:'misc',sub:'Gambling',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on gambling and lottery?',a:'Gambling is absolutely forbidden. The Quran groups it with alcohol and idolatry as abominations. All forms: casinos, betting shops, online gambling, crypto gambling, sports wagering, and lottery. The harm is clear: addiction, financial ruin, family destruction, and social corruption. Prizes from genuine competitions (academic, athletic, skill-based) are halal because the outcome depends on effort and ability, not mere chance.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['gambling','lottery','haram','betting','prohibited','games']},
{id:'ms018',cat:'misc',sub:'Gambling',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on gambling and lottery?',a:'Gambling is one of the clear-cut prohibitions in Islam. Modern forms include: online poker, fantasy sports with money, cryptocurrency gambling, prediction markets with stakes, and even some stock options that function as gambling. The test: is the outcome primarily determined by chance with money at stake? If yes, it is gambling. Skill-based competitions with prizes are different — entering a coding contest, academic olympiad, or sports tournament for prizes is halal.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['gambling','lottery','haram','betting','prohibited','games']},
{id:'ms019',cat:'misc',sub:'Environmental Ethics',marja:'sistani',q:'What does Islam say about environmental protection?',a:'Islam emphasizes stewardship (khilafah) of the earth. Humans are trustees, not owners, of the natural world. Key principles: (1) Waste is prohibited — "Eat and drink but waste not" (7:31), (2) Water conservation — even during wudu by a river, one should not waste water, (3) Planting trees is an ongoing charity, (4) Pollution that harms others\' health is prohibited under "la darar" (no harm), (5) Hunting endangered species is problematic, (6) Destroying crops and livestock in war is forbidden. These principles strongly support modern environmental protection.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['environment','stewardship','protection','waste','islam','conservation']},
{id:'ms020',cat:'misc',sub:'Environmental Ethics',marja:'makarem',q:'What does Islam say about environmental protection?',a:'Environmental stewardship is a fundamental Islamic value. The Prophet (s) said: "If the Day of Judgment arrives and you have a seedling in your hand, plant it." Key environmental ethics: (1) Don\'t waste resources — water, food, energy, (2) Don\'t cause fasad fil-ard (corruption on earth), (3) Every living creature has rights, (4) Future generations have a claim on current resources. Climate change, pollution, and environmental destruction are forms of fasad that Islam opposes. Muslims should be at the forefront of environmental protection.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['environment','stewardship','protection','waste','islam','conservation']},
{id:'ms021',cat:'misc',sub:'Environmental Ethics',marja:'noori',q:'What does Islam say about environmental protection?',a:'The earth is an amanah (trust) from Allah. We will be asked about how we treated it. Islamic environmental principles include: ihsan (excellence) in treating creation, mizan (balance) in using resources, avoiding israf (waste), and maintaining the natural systems Allah created. Imam Ali (as) in Nahj al-Balagha frequently referenced natural phenomena as signs of divine wisdom — destroying these signs is opposing divine will. Conservation, sustainability, and green living align perfectly with Islamic values.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['environment','stewardship','protection','waste','islam','conservation']},
{id:'ms022',cat:'misc',sub:'Charity',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the best forms of charity (sadaqah) in Islam?',a:'The best forms of sadaqah include: (1) Sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity): building wells, schools, mosques, hospitals, (2) Teaching knowledge — the Prophet (s) said it\'s better than material charity, (3) Helping someone find employment — giving them a means of sustenance, (4) Feeding the hungry — especially during famines and disasters, (5) Caring for orphans — "I and the guardian of an orphan are like this in Paradise" (gesture of two fingers together), (6) Removing harm from the path — even small acts count, (7) Secret charity — giving without anyone knowing is more rewarded.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['charity','sadaqah','giving','orphan','ongoing','best']},

The Prophet (s) said: "Every act of kindness is charity." Even a kind word is sadaqah. The spirit is generosity in all forms — material, emotional, and spiritual.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['charity','sadaqah','giving','orphan','ongoing','best']},

{id:'ms024',cat:'misc',sub:'Gambling',marja:'sistani',q:'Is gambling (qimar) permissible in any form?',a:'All forms of gambling are absolutely haram in Islam. This includes: casino games, lotteries, sports betting, poker for money, slot machines, and any game where money is wagered on uncertain outcomes. The Quran explicitly prohibits it: "O believers, intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and divination are an abomination of Satan\'s work — avoid them" (5:90).

{id:'ms025',cat:'misc',sub:'Gambling',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is gambling (qimar) permissible in any form?',a:'Gambling in all forms is haram — no exceptions. This extends to: online gambling, cryptocurrency trading that functions as gambling (pure speculation without underlying value), lottery tickets, raffle tickets with entry fees, and betting on sports events. Prize competitions where entry is free (no financial risk to participants) are generally permissible. The distinction is whether the participant risks their own money on an uncertain outcome.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['gambling','haram','lottery','betting','prohibited']},
{id:'ms026',cat:'misc',sub:'Gambling',marja:'makarem',q:'Is gambling (qimar) permissible in any form?',a:'The Quran categorically prohibits gambling alongside alcohol and idolatry (5:90-91). This covers all forms: traditional gambling, modern casino games, online betting, lotteries, and speculative schemes. Even small-stakes gambling "for fun" is haram because it cultivates the gambling mentality. Games played for entertainment without money are fine — chess, card games, video games are permissible when played without betting.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['gambling','haram','lottery','betting','prohibited']},
{id:'ms027',cat:'misc',sub:'Backbiting',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on backbiting (ghibah)?',a:'Backbiting (ghibah) is haram and a major sin. It is defined as saying something true about a person behind their back that they would dislike hearing. The Quran compares it to eating the flesh of one\'s dead brother (49:12). It is worse than lying because the victim has no defense. Repentance requires: stopping the behavior, seeking forgiveness from Allah, and ideally seeking forgiveness from the person if it won\'t cause greater harm. Exceptions: warning about someone who is a danger, seeking fatwa about a situation, criticizing public officials\' public conduct.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['backbiting','ghibah','sin','forbidden','social']},
{id:'ms028',cat:'misc',sub:'Backbiting',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on backbiting (ghibah)?',a:'Ghibah is among the sins most strongly condemned in Quran and hadith. The Prophet (s) said: "Ghibah is worse than zina (fornication) because the fornicator can repent and be forgiven, but the backbiter is not forgiven until the person they backbit forgives them." Limited exceptions exist: warning someone about a danger (nasiha), testimony in court, seeking religious ruling where details are necessary, and criticizing a public figure\'s public actions.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['backbiting','ghibah','sin','forbidden','social']},
{id:'ms029',cat:'misc',sub:'Backbiting',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on backbiting (ghibah)?',a:'Backbiting destroys social fabric and is severely condemned. Even listening to ghibah is sinful — one should stop the speaker or leave the gathering. The cure includes: reflecting on one\'s own faults, recognizing the spiritual damage ghibah causes to oneself, and making a firm resolution to speak only good about others. The Prophet (s) said: "Let the one who believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good or remain silent."',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['backbiting','ghibah','sin','forbidden','social']},
{id:'ms030',cat:'misc',sub:'Lying',marja:'sistani',q:'Is lying ever permissible?',a:'Lying is haram in principle. However, specific exceptions exist: (1) To save a life — lying to protect someone from being killed is obligatory, (2) To reconcile between people — using diplomatic language to resolve conflicts, (3) Taqiyyah — concealing one\'s beliefs to protect oneself from persecution, (4) In war (strategic deception against enemies). Even in these cases, if the goal can be achieved without lying, lying should be avoided. Using ambiguous language (tawriyah) that is technically true but misleading is permissible in cases of necessity.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['lying','permissible','exceptions','taqiyyah','truth']},
{id:'ms031',cat:'misc',sub:'Lying',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is lying ever permissible?',a:'Lying is generally haram with recognized exceptions based on maslaha (greater benefit): saving life, preventing harm, reconciliation between people, and taqiyyah in situations of genuine danger. The exceptions are precisely defined — one cannot extend them to everyday convenience. White lies for politeness (like complimenting cooking one doesn\'t enjoy) are a separate discussion — scholars generally permit social courtesy that avoids hurting feelings.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['lying','permissible','exceptions','taqiyyah','truth']},
{id:'ms032',cat:'misc',sub:'Lying',marja:'noori',q:'Is lying ever permissible?',a:'The Prophet (s) said: "Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise." Lying is fundamentally haram. The exceptions are narrow and well-defined: protecting life, reconciling people, taqiyyah, and marital diplomacy (saying kind things to one\'s spouse). The Imams (as) were known as al-Sadiq (the truthful), emphasizing the centrality of honesty to Islamic character. Habitual lying darkens the heart and destroys trust.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['lying','permissible','exceptions','taqiyyah','truth']},

{id:'ms034',cat:'misc',sub:'Environment',marja:'khamenei',q:'What does Islam say about environmental responsibility?',a:'Environmental protection is an Islamic obligation rooted in the concept of divine trust (amanah).

{id:'ms035',cat:'misc',sub:'Environment',marja:'makarem',q:'What does Islam say about environmental responsibility?',a:'The Quran says: "Do not cause corruption on earth after it has been set right" (7:56). Environmental responsibility includes: efficient use of resources, minimizing waste, protecting biodiversity, avoiding pollution, and sustainable agriculture.

{id:'ms036',cat:'misc',sub:'Istikhara',marja:'sistani',q:'What is istikhara and how is it performed?',a:'Istikhara is seeking Allah\'s guidance when making a decision after proper human deliberation. Methods include: (1) Prayer istikhara — pray 2 rak\'ahs and ask Allah for guidance, then observe if the heart inclines toward or away from the matter, (2) Quran istikhara — pray, then open the Quran randomly and derive guidance, (3) Tasbih istikhara — using prayer beads with a specific process. Istikhara should be used after one has done proper research and consultation — not as a replacement for rational thinking.

{id:'ms037',cat:'misc',sub:'Istikhara',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is istikhara and how is it performed?',a:'Istikhara is a spiritual tool used after human effort (research, consultation, deliberation) has been exhausted and one remains undecided. It is not meant for decisions where the answer is clear or for everyday trivial matters. The best method is salat al-istikhara followed by trusting one\'s inclination. Quran istikhara through a scholar is also common. The result should be accepted with trust in Allah. Repeatedly doing istikhara for the same question is inappropriate.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['istikhara','guidance','quran','prayer','decision']},
{id:'ms038',cat:'misc',sub:'Istikhara',marja:'makarem',q:'What is istikhara and how is it performed?',a:'Istikhara has specific etiquette: (1) It is for genuinely undecided matters after human deliberation, (2) It should not replace rational analysis, (3) It should not be used for matters where Islamic law provides clear guidance, (4) The result should be respected, (5) It can be done personally or through a scholar. The essence is tawakkul (reliance on Allah) after tying your camel — doing your human best first.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['istikhara','guidance','quran','prayer','decision']},
{id:'ms039',cat:'misc',sub:'Dreams',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on dreams?',a:'Dreams in Islam fall into three categories: (1) True dreams (ru\'ya sadiqah) — genuine divine communication, more common for the righteous, especially near dawn, (2) Self-reflective dreams — arising from one\'s thoughts, fears, and experiences, (3) Disturbing dreams — from shaytan. No legal ruling can be derived from dreams — they cannot make something halal or haram. Prophetic dreams were exclusive to prophets. If one has a good dream, they should praise Allah; if bad, seek refuge in Allah and not share it. Dream interpretation is not an exact science.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['dreams','interpretation','vision','sleep','islamic']},
{id:'ms040',cat:'misc',sub:'Dreams',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on dreams?',a:'Islam acknowledges dreams as potentially meaningful but warns against over-reliance. The Prophet (s) said true dreams are 1/46th of prophethood. However: dreams cannot be used to derive religious rulings, they should not override reason and knowledge, interpretation requires expertise, and disturbing dreams should be dismissed. The best approach is: thank Allah for good dreams, seek protection from bad ones, and make decisions based on rational analysis and Islamic guidance rather than dream content.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['dreams','interpretation','vision','sleep','islamic']},

This includes: casino games, card games for money, sports betting, lottery, slot machines, and any game where money is wagered on uncertain outcomes.

{id:'ms044',cat:'misc',sub:'Chess',marja:'sistani',q:'Is playing chess permissible?',a:'Playing chess is permissible if: (1) It is not played for gambling (no betting), (2) It does not cause neglect of religious obligations, (3) It does not consume excessive time that should be spent on beneficial activities.

{id:'ms045',cat:'misc',sub:'Chess',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is playing chess permissible?',a:'Chess is permissible under conditions: no gambling, no neglecting duties, and the game is treated as an intellectual exercise.

Islam does not prohibit altering one\'s appearance for beautification. This includes: rhinoplasty (nose surgery), facelifts, corrective procedures, and other cosmetic enhancements. The conditions are: (1) The procedure must not involve haram (e.g., gender transition surgery is a separate discussion), (2) It should not cause disproportionate health risk, (3) A non-mahram doctor of opposite gender is permitted for medical necessity when a same-gender doctor is unavailable.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['plastic surgery','cosmetic','permissible','beautification','appearance']},
{id:'ms048',cat:'misc',sub:'Plastic Surgery',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is cosmetic/plastic surgery permissible?',a:'Cosmetic surgery is permissible as a general rule. There is no Islamic basis for claiming it is "changing God\'s creation" in the prohibited sense — the Quranic verse about changing creation refers to following Satan in corrupting human nature, not physical modification.

{id:'ms049',cat:'misc',sub:'Plastic Surgery',marja:'makarem',q:'Is cosmetic/plastic surgery permissible?',a:'Beautification is permitted in Islam — the Prophet (s) encouraged looking presentable.

{id:'ms050',cat:'misc',sub:'Adoption',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic view on adoption?',a:'Islam encourages caring for orphans — it is among the most praised acts. However, Islam distinguishes between kafala (guardianship/sponsorship) and tabanni (full adoption that changes lineage). Full adoption that changes the child\'s surname and creates false lineage is not permitted — the child should know their biological parents. However: providing a home, education, love, and care through kafala is highly encouraged. The guardian can give the child inheritance through wasiyyah (up to 1/3).',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['adoption','kafala','orphans','guardianship','lineage']},
{id:'ms051',cat:'misc',sub:'Adoption',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the Islamic view on adoption?',a:'Caring for orphans is a major Islamic value — the Quran praises it extensively. The distinction is about lineage, not care. The child keeps their family name and inheritance connections. But in every practical sense, they are part of the family. Mahramiyyah can be established through breastfeeding the child (by the guardian\'s wife or a relative). The guardian family should love and treat the child exactly as their own.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['adoption','kafala','orphans','guardianship','lineage']},
{id:'ms052',cat:'misc',sub:'Adoption',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the Islamic view on adoption?',a:'Islam transformed pre-Islamic adoption practices to protect children\'s identity rights. The child keeps their biological identity while receiving full love and care. Practical implications: the guardian provides everything a parent would — home, education, affection, financial support. The only differences are: lineage preservation and mahram rules (addressed through breastfeeding). Emotionally and practically, Islamic guardianship is parenting in every meaningful sense.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['adoption','kafala','orphans','guardianship','lineage']},

The Quran equates dealing in riba with waging war against Allah (2:279). Rules: (1) Giving interest-based loans is haram, (2) Taking interest-based loans is haram unless absolutely necessary (like buying a home when no alternative exists — the sin falls on the lender), (3) Receiving interest from Islamic banks under Sharia-compliant contracts is halal, (4) Interest received from non-Muslim banks in non-Muslim countries — some scholars permit taking it as it is not riba between Muslims.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['riba','interest','banking','haram','islamic finance']},

However, practical rulings: deposits in Islamic banks under mudarabah or musharakah contracts are halal — the profit share is not riba. In non-Muslim countries, interest received from banks can be taken as permissible income according to some views, since the prohibition applies to transactions between Muslims.
