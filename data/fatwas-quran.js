{id:'qr001',cat:'quran',sub:'Touching Quran',marja:'sistani',q:'Can one touch the Quran without wudu?',a:'It is haram to touch the script (writing) of the Quran without wudu. This applies to the Arabic text of the Quran specifically — not the cover, margins, or translation text. Touching the Arabic verses on any medium (paper, screen, stone) without wudu is prohibited. This applies to the names of Allah and attributes that are specific to Him. A person in the state of janabah must not touch the Quranic script.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['quran','touching','wudu','script','taharat']},
{id:'qr002',cat:'quran',sub:'Touching Quran',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one touch the Quran without wudu?',a:'Touching the Arabic text of the Quran without wudu is forbidden. This includes Quranic verses wherever they appear — on walls, jewelry, decorative items. The prohibition extends to the names of the 14 Ma\'sumin when written with the intention of their sacred status. For digital screens displaying Quran, touching the screen while a verse is displayed follows the same rule on the basis of precaution.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['quran','touching','wudu','script','taharat']},
{id:'qr003',cat:'quran',sub:'Touching Quran',marja:'makarem',q:'Can one touch the Quran without wudu?',a:'Wudu is required to touch the writing of the Quran. This is based on the Quran itself: "None touch it except the purified" (56:79). Translation text in other languages is not subject to this ruling. For educational purposes with children who haven\'t reached bulugh, touching without wudu is not sinful for them, but teaching them to have wudu is recommended.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['quran','touching','wudu','script','taharat']},
{id:'qr004',cat:'quran',sub:'Recitation',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the etiquettes of Quran recitation?',a:'Recommended etiquettes include: (1) Being in a state of wudu, (2) Sitting facing Qiblah, (3) Beginning with "A\'udhu billahi min al-shaytan al-rajim" followed by Bismillah, (4) Reciting with tarteel (measured, beautiful pace), (5) Reflecting on meanings (tadabbur), (6) Performing sajdah when reaching obligatory sajdah verses (4 verses require obligatory sajdah). It is recommended to recite Quran daily, especially after Fajr prayer. Recitation while in state of janabah is not haram (except Surah al-Sajdah, al-Najm, Fussilat, and al-Alaq) but is makruh.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['recitation','etiquette','tarteel','wudu','quran']},
{id:'qr005',cat:'quran',sub:'Recitation',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the etiquettes of Quran recitation?',a:'Recitation etiquettes: wudu, clean place, facing Qiblah, tarteel, contemplation, responding to verses of mercy with dua and verses of punishment with seeking refuge. Learning tajwid (rules of proper recitation) is recommended for all Muslims. Daily recitation, even a few verses, brings great reward. The Quran should be treated with the utmost respect — not placed on the floor, not turned upside down.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['recitation','etiquette','tarteel','wudu','quran']},
{id:'qr006',cat:'quran',sub:'Recitation',marja:'noori',q:'What are the etiquettes of Quran recitation?',a:'The Quran is a guide and healing (shifa). Its recitation should be approached with: spiritual preparation (wudu, clean environment), intellectual engagement (understanding meanings), emotional connection (allowing the heart to be affected), and practical commitment (implementing its teachings). Imam Sadiq (as) said: "The Quran is Allah\'s covenant — one should see how they treat their covenant with Allah."',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['recitation','etiquette','tarteel','wudu','quran']},
{id:'qr007',cat:'quran',sub:'Obligatory Sajdah',marja:'sistani',q:'Which Quran verses require obligatory prostration?',a:'Four verses require obligatory sajdah immediately upon hearing or reciting them: (1) Surah al-Sajdah (32:15), (2) Surah Fussilat (41:37), (3) Surah al-Najm (53:62), (4) Surah al-Alaq (96:19). Upon hearing or reciting these verses, one must prostrate immediately (even without wudu). The prostration is one sajdah with dhikr. It is recommended (not obligatory) to prostrate at 11 additional sajdah verses throughout the Quran.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['sajdah','prostration','obligatory','quran','verses']},
{id:'qr008',cat:'quran',sub:'Obligatory Sajdah',marja:'khamenei',q:'Which Quran verses require obligatory prostration?',a:'The four obligatory sajdah surahs are: al-Sajdah, Fussilat, al-Najm, and al-Alaq. These four are called "Aza\'im" — surahs with obligatory prostration. It is haram for a person in the state of janabah to recite even one verse from these four surahs. The sajdah should be performed on a valid surface (turbah, earth, or what grows from earth).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['sajdah','prostration','obligatory','quran','verses']},
{id:'qr009',cat:'quran',sub:'Obligatory Sajdah',marja:'makarem',q:'Which Quran verses require obligatory prostration?',a:'Four Quranic prostrations are wajib — at the end of Surahs 32, 41, 53, and 96. Eleven others are mustahab. The obligatory sajdah requires: immediate performance upon hearing/reciting, placing the forehead on a valid surface, and saying the dhikr (Subhan Allahi Rabbi wa bihamdihi or similar). If one is driving or in a situation where immediate sajdah is impossible, they should prostrate as soon as possible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['sajdah','prostration','obligatory','quran','verses']},
{id:'qr010',cat:'quran',sub:'Memorization',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the reward and ruling on memorizing the Quran?',a:'Memorizing the Quran (hifz) is highly recommended and brings immense spiritual reward. The Prophet (s) said: "The best among you is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it." While memorization is mustahab (recommended), not wajib (obligatory), understanding and implementing the Quran is essential. A hafiz (one who has memorized) has a special status in Islamic community. It is important to maintain what one has memorized — forgetting after memorizing is considered blameworthy.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['memorization','hifz','reward','quran','learning']},
{id:'qr011',cat:'quran',sub:'Memorization',marja:'noori',q:'What is the reward and ruling on memorizing the Quran?',a:'Memorization is a noble pursuit that the Imams (as) greatly encouraged. However, memorization without understanding is incomplete. The ideal is to combine hifz with tafsir (understanding), tadabbur (reflection), and amal (practice). The Quran itself says: "We have made the Quran easy for remembrance" (54:17). Children should be encouraged to memorize from a young age while also being taught meanings.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['memorization','hifz','reward','quran','learning']},
{id:'qr012',cat:'quran',sub:'Memorization',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the reward and ruling on memorizing the Quran?',a:'The Quran encourages its own memorization and study. Historically, oral transmission was the primary means of Quranic preservation. Rewards for memorization include: elevated status in the hereafter, intercession (shafa\'ah), and spiritual light. A household where Quran is recited regularly attracts divine mercy. The goal is not just memorization but living by Quranic principles.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['memorization','hifz','reward','quran','learning']},

{id:'qr013',cat:'quran',sub:'Translation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to read the Quran only in translation?',a:'Reading Quran in translation is beneficial for understanding and is encouraged. However, the translation is not "Quran" in the legal sense — it is an interpretation of the meaning. For ritual purposes (recitation in salat), only the Arabic text is valid. For personal study, reflection, and learning, translations are invaluable and every Muslim should access Quran in a language they understand. The original Arabic remains the authoritative text. Using parallel Arabic-translation editions is ideal.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['translation','language','arabic','quran','reading']},
{id:'qr014',cat:'quran',sub:'Translation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to read the Quran only in translation?',a:'Quran translation is a valuable tool for understanding, but it is not a substitute for the Arabic Quran. Every translation is inherently an interpretation and loses some meaning. Muslims should: learn basic Arabic Quran recitation for prayer, study tafsir (exegesis) in their language, and use translations for understanding while recognizing their limitations. The effort to learn Arabic to access the Quran directly is highly rewarded.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['translation','language','arabic','quran','reading']},
{id:'qr015',cat:'quran',sub:'Translation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to read the Quran only in translation?',a:'Translations serve an essential purpose — making Quranic guidance accessible to non-Arabic speakers. However, translations are human interpretations and can never fully capture the Arabic Quran\'s depth. For daily spiritual benefit, reading in translation is absolutely valid and recommended. For prayer, Arabic is required. Ideally, a Muslim should progressively learn enough Arabic to read the original while relying on translations for detailed understanding.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['translation','language','arabic','quran','reading']},
{id:'qr016',cat:'quran',sub:'Tafsir',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the importance of tafsir (Quranic exegesis)?',a:'Tafsir is essential for proper understanding of the Quran. Without scholarly exegesis, verses can be misunderstood or taken out of context. Shia tafsir relies on: (1) The Quran explaining itself (tafsir al-Quran bil-Quran), (2) Hadith of the Prophet (s) and Imams (as), (3) Arabic linguistic analysis, (4) Rational analysis (aql), (5) Historical context (asbab al-nuzul). Recommended tafsirs include: Tafsir al-Mizan by Allamah Tabataba\'i, Majma\' al-Bayan by Tabarsi, and Al-Tibyan by Shaykh Tusi.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tafsir','exegesis','understanding','commentary','scholars']},
{id:'qr017',cat:'quran',sub:'Tafsir',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the importance of tafsir (Quranic exegesis)?',a:'Understanding Quran through tafsir is a duty for every Muslim at their level. The Quran itself commands tadabbur (reflection). Shia tafsir has a rich tradition: from Imam Ali\'s direct explanations to modern comprehensive works. Students should begin with accessible tafsirs and progressively move to more detailed works. The tafsir of the Ahlul Bayt (as) is the most authentic key to understanding Quran, as the Prophet (s) left the Quran and his household together as guides.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['tafsir','exegesis','understanding','commentary','scholars']},
{id:'qr018',cat:'quran',sub:'Tafsir',marja:'noori',q:'What is the importance of tafsir (Quranic exegesis)?',a:'Tafsir prevents misinterpretation and extremism. The Prophet (s) warned against interpreting Quran without knowledge. The Shia advantage is having the living commentary of the Imams (as) — their hadith illuminate Quranic meanings in ways no other source can. Recommended approach: begin with Al-Mizan for its depth, use Tafsir Namuneh (by Makarem Shirazi) for accessibility, and study Nur al-Thaqalayn for hadith-based understanding.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['tafsir','exegesis','understanding','commentary','scholars']},
{id:'qr019',cat:'quran',sub:'Quran in Daily Life',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the benefits of regular Quran recitation?',a:'Regular Quran recitation brings: (1) Spiritual illumination and peace of heart, (2) Protection from spiritual ailments, (3) Intercession (shafa\'ah) on the Day of Judgment, (4) Reward multiplied for each letter recited, (5) Elevation of status in this world and the next. The Prophet (s) said: "The best among you is he who learns the Quran and teaches it." Even reciting without full comprehension has spiritual benefit, though understanding amplifies the reward. Consistent daily recitation, even a few verses, is better than occasional large amounts.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['recitation','benefits','daily','spiritual','reward']},
{id:'qr020',cat:'quran',sub:'Quran in Daily Life',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the benefits of regular Quran recitation?',a:'The Quran describes itself as "a healing for what is in the hearts" (10:57). Benefits of regular recitation include: tranquility (sakinah) descends during recitation, angels gather around the reciter, the house where Quran is recited shines for the inhabitants of heaven, and the Quran intercedes for its regular reciter on Judgment Day. The minimum recommended is reciting a portion (hizb or juz) daily. Specific surahs have specific benefits: Ya-Sin for ease of death, Al-Mulk for protection in the grave, Al-Waqi\'ah for provision.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['recitation','benefits','daily','spiritual','reward']},
{id:'qr021',cat:'quran',sub:'Translation',marja:'sistani',q:'Can the Quran be translated and is translated Quran considered Quran?',a:'The Quran can be translated for educational purposes, and this is recommended to make its message accessible to non-Arabic speakers. However, a translation is an interpretation, not the Quran itself — the Arabic text is the divine revelation. Rules specific to the Quran (such as requiring wudu to touch its script) apply only to the Arabic text, not translations. Translations should be made by qualified scholars who understand both Arabic and Quranic sciences.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['translation','quran','arabic','interpretation','language']},
{id:'qr022',cat:'quran',sub:'Translation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can the Quran be translated and is translated Quran considered Quran?',a:'Translation of the Quran is encouraged to spread understanding. However, every translation is inherently an interpretation and cannot fully capture the depth of the Arabic original. Multiple translations should be consulted for important passages. Learning Arabic to understand the Quran directly is highly recommended. Touch-related rulings apply only to the Arabic text.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['translation','quran','arabic','interpretation','language']},
{id:'qr023',cat:'quran',sub:'Translation',marja:'makarem',q:'Can the Quran be translated and is translated Quran considered Quran?',a:'Translating the Quran is an important service to humanity. The Quran itself says it was revealed "in clear Arabic" but its message is universal. Quality translations paired with tafsir (commentary) help non-Arabic speakers access Islamic guidance. However, relying solely on translation without scholarly guidance can lead to misunderstanding, especially for legal and theological verses.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['translation','quran','arabic','interpretation','language']},
{id:'qr024',cat:'quran',sub:'Tafsir',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the importance of tafsir (Quran commentary)?',a:'Tafsir is essential for proper understanding of the Quran. Without scholarly commentary, readers may misinterpret verses due to: historical context, Arabic linguistic nuances, abrogation rules, and the interrelationship between verses. Major Shia tafsirs include: Tafsir al-Mizan by Allamah Tabatabai, Majma\' al-Bayan by Tabarsi, and Tafsir al-Qummi. Every Muslim should study the Quran through reliable tafsir, not just translation alone.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tafsir','commentary','understanding','tafsir al-mizan','scholarship']},
{id:'qr025',cat:'quran',sub:'Tafsir',marja:'noori',q:'What is the importance of tafsir (Quran commentary)?',a:'Tafsir connects the Quran to life. The Imams (as) emphasized that the Quran must be understood through the Ahlul Bayt (as) — the Prophet said: "I leave behind two weighty things: the Book of Allah and my Ahlul Bayt." Shia tafsir incorporates the narrations of the Imams, providing authentic interpretation. Modern tafsir also addresses contemporary issues in light of Quranic principles.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['tafsir','commentary','understanding','tafsir al-mizan','scholarship']},
{id:'qr026',cat:'quran',sub:'Tafsir',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the importance of tafsir (Quran commentary)?',a:'The Quran says: "Will they not reflect on the Quran?" (4:82) — but reflection requires knowledge and methodology. Tafsir provides: historical context (shan-e-nuzul), linguistic analysis, connection to hadith, and practical application. Tafsir al-Namuneh (by Makarem Shirazi) was written specifically to make Quranic understanding accessible to modern readers. Every Muslim should engage with at least one reliable tafsir.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['tafsir','commentary','understanding','tafsir al-mizan','scholarship']},
{id:'qr027',cat:'quran',sub:'Desecration',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on desecrating the Quran?',a:'Desecrating the Quran is absolutely haram and one of the greatest sins. This includes: intentionally damaging, burning (except old worn copies with proper respect), throwing on the ground, or placing in filthy locations. If a Quran is in danger of desecration (e.g., in a flood), saving it takes priority over other property. Old worn Qurans should be: buried with respect, placed in flowing water, or stored safely — not simply thrown in trash.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['desecration','respect','handling','disposal','sin']},
{id:'qr028',cat:'quran',sub:'Desecration',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on desecrating the Quran?',a:'Disrespecting the Quran in any form is haram. This extends to digital Qurans — intentionally deleting Quran apps or files to show disrespect is sinful (normal deletion for device management is fine). If one sees a Quran being disrespected, they are obligated to intervene. Disposing of old Qurans should be done respectfully — wrapping and burying is the most common method.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['desecration','respect','handling','disposal','sin']},
{id:'qr029',cat:'quran',sub:'Desecration',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on desecrating the Quran?',a:'The Quran must be treated with utmost respect. Even pages with partial Quranic verses should be handled carefully. In the digital age, this principle extends to showing respect when Quran is displayed on screens. Burning the Quran as an act of hate is among the most condemned actions. Muslim communities should educate others about proper handling and offer respectful disposal services for worn copies.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['desecration','respect','handling','disposal','sin']},
{id:'qr030',cat:'quran',sub:'Digital Quran',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rulings on digital Quran (apps, websites)?',a:'Digital Quran apps and websites are valid means of reading and studying the Quran. The rules: (1) Touching the screen displaying Arabic Quranic text without wudu — the precautionary ruling varies among scholars; some consider it similar to touching a printed Quran, others distinguish between direct text and digital display. On the basis of obligatory precaution, have wudu when touching verses on screen. (2) Playing Quran audio is respectful — listeners should be attentive. (3) Quran apps should be developed and used with respect.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['digital','apps','quran','screen','technology']},
{id:'qr031',cat:'quran',sub:'Digital Quran',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rulings on digital Quran (apps, websites)?',a:'Digital Quran has made access to the Holy Book universal — this is positive. Regarding touching screens with Quranic text: obligatory precaution advises having wudu. Audio Quran should be treated respectfully — not played as background noise during inappropriate activities. Quran apps should not be placed in a device alongside haram content (inappropriate images, etc.) though this is about respect, not strict legal prohibition.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['digital','apps','quran','screen','technology']},
{id:'qr032',cat:'quran',sub:'Digital Quran',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rulings on digital Quran (apps, websites)?',a:'Technology serves the Quran beautifully — searchable text, audio recitation, tafsir access, memorization tools. Treat digital Quran with the same respect as physical copies. Having wudu when interacting with Quranic text on screen is recommended. When Quran is playing, give it attention — the Quran says: "When the Quran is recited, listen to it and pay attention" (7:204). This applies to digital recitation too.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['digital','apps','quran','screen','technology']},
{id:'qr033',cat:'quran',sub:'Children',marja:'sistani',q:'At what age should children begin learning Quran?',a:'Teaching Quran to children should begin as early as possible — playing Quran recitation for infants, teaching short surahs at age 3-4, and formal reading instruction at age 5-6. The Prophet (s) said: "The best of you is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it." Making Quran learning enjoyable for children is important — forced, harsh teaching methods are counterproductive. Rewards and encouragement work better than punishment.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['children','education','learning','age','teaching']},
{id:'qr034',cat:'quran',sub:'Children',marja:'noori',q:'At what age should children begin learning Quran?',a:'Begin with exposure — babies hearing Quran recitation absorb its melody and connection to faith. Formal instruction can begin when the child shows readiness, typically around 4-5 years. The approach should be: loving, patient, fun, and consistent. Connecting Quran stories to children\'s lives makes it relevant. Parents who recite Quran themselves model the behavior naturally. The goal is to create love for the Quran, not just ability to read it.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['children','education','learning','age','teaching']},
{id:'qr035',cat:'quran',sub:'Children',marja:'makarem',q:'At what age should children begin learning Quran?',a:'Early childhood is the golden period for Quran education. The mind absorbs easily and what is learned stays. Begin with: Surah al-Fatiha, short surahs (al-Ikhlas, al-Kawthar), and beautiful stories from the Quran. Use age-appropriate methods — games, songs, visual aids, rewards. Never associate Quran learning with punishment. A child who loves the Quran will turn to it throughout their life.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['children','education','learning','age','teaching']},
{id:'qr036',cat:'quran',sub:'Quranic Healing',marja:'sistani',q:'Is using Quran for healing (ruqyah) permissible?',a:'Reciting Quran for healing (ruqyah) is permissible and recommended. The Quran itself says: "We send down in the Quran that which is a healing and mercy for the believers" (17:82). Methods include: reciting specific surahs and verses for the sick, blowing on water and drinking it, and writing verses for the patient. This should complement, not replace, medical treatment. Selling "Quranic healing" as a business exploiting desperate people is condemned.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ruqyah','healing','quran','spiritual','medical']},
{id:'qr037',cat:'quran',sub:'Quranic Healing',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is using Quran for healing (ruqyah) permissible?',a:'Quranic healing is a legitimate spiritual practice supported by Quran and hadith. Specific verses and surahs have healing properties. However: (1) This should not replace proper medical care, (2) Charlatans who exploit people\'s faith for money should be exposed, (3) The healing effect depends on faith and Allah\'s will — it is not magic. Combining spiritual healing with medical treatment is the balanced approach.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['ruqyah','healing','quran','spiritual','medical']},
{id:'qr038',cat:'quran',sub:'Quranic Healing',marja:'makarem',q:'Is using Quran for healing (ruqyah) permissible?',a:'The Quran is shifa (healing) — this is its own statement about itself. Reciting Surah al-Fatiha, Ayat al-Kursi, and the Mu\'awwidhatayn for healing is well-established in hadith. Write verses, recite over water, blow gently on the patient — these are prophetic practices. But never delay necessary medical treatment in favor of only spiritual healing. Islam promotes using ALL available means of cure.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['ruqyah','healing','quran','spiritual','medical']},
