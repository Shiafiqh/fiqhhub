{id:'jd001',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Islamic Judge',marja:'sistani',q:'Who qualifies as an Islamic judge (qadi)?',a:'A qadi must be: (1) Muslim, (2) Male (on obligatory precaution), (3) Adult and sane, (4) Born legitimate, (5) Just (adil), (6) A mujtahid — capable of deriving rulings from Islamic sources. During the occultation, the most qualified mujtahid or his appointed representative serves as judge. The qadi should be the most knowledgeable person available for the position.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['qadi','judge','qualifications','judiciary']},
{id:'jd002',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Islamic Judge',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who qualifies as an Islamic judge (qadi)?',a:'In the Islamic Republic framework, judges are appointed through the judicial system under the supervision of the Wali al-Faqih. They must have Islamic jurisprudential knowledge, be just, and have proper qualifications. The Islamic judiciary combines fiqh expertise with modern legal training. The ultimate judicial authority rests with the Wali al-Faqih.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['qadi','judge','qualifications','judiciary']},
{id:'jd003',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Islamic Judge',marja:'makarem',q:'Who qualifies as an Islamic judge (qadi)?',a:'The qualifications for a qadi are stringent: ijtihad (or authorization from a mujtahid), justice, sound judgment, and complete impartiality. A judge must not accept gifts from litigants, must give both parties equal treatment in seating and attention, and must not judge while angry, hungry, or emotionally compromised.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['qadi','judge','qualifications','judiciary']},
{id:'jd004',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Evidence',marja:'sistani',q:'What constitutes valid evidence in Islamic court?',a:'Valid evidence includes: (1) Testimony of two just male witnesses for most cases, (2) One male and two female witnesses for financial matters, (3) Confession (iqrar), (4) Oath (yamin/qasam), (5) The judge\'s own knowledge (ilm al-qadi) — a judge may rule based on his certain knowledge. Documentary evidence is accepted when it leads to certainty. Modern forensic evidence can be used if it produces certainty (ilm) for the judge.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['evidence','testimony','witnesses','court','proof']},
{id:'jd005',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Evidence',marja:'khamenei',q:'What constitutes valid evidence in Islamic court?',a:'Evidence categories include witness testimony, confession, oaths, and the judge\'s knowledge. Modern evidence such as DNA testing, digital records, CCTV footage, and forensic analysis are valid sources of judicial knowledge when they produce certainty. The judge evaluates all evidence holistically.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['evidence','testimony','witnesses','court','proof']},
{id:'jd006',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Evidence',marja:'hakim',q:'What constitutes valid evidence in Islamic court?',a:'The classical evidence system includes bayyinah (testimony), iqrar (confession), yamin (oath), and ilm al-qadi (judge\'s knowledge). The judge has discretion to evaluate evidence quality. If witnesses contradict each other or show signs of unreliability, the judge may reject their testimony. The standard is certainty or strong probability.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['evidence','testimony','witnesses','court','proof']},
{id:'jd007',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Testimony',marja:'sistani',q:'Can women serve as witnesses in Islamic courts?',a:'Women\'s testimony is accepted in Islamic law with specific frameworks: (1) In financial matters, one man and two women or four women alone, (2) In matters exclusively known to women (such as birth, virginity, certain medical issues), women\'s testimony alone is sufficient, (3) In criminal cases requiring hadd punishments, the classical requirement is male witnesses. However, women\'s testimony is fully accepted in many civil matters.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['women','testimony','witnesses','court','gender']},
{id:'jd008',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Testimony',marja:'makarem',q:'Can women serve as witnesses in Islamic courts?',a:'Women can testify in various categories of cases. The requirement for two women in place of one man in financial matters is explained by scholars as relating to the historical social context, not inherent capability. In modern times, educated women whose testimony is reliable should be given appropriate weight by the judge. In matters exclusive to women, only women\'s testimony is accepted.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['women','testimony','witnesses','court','gender']},
{id:'jd009',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Testimony',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can women serve as witnesses in Islamic courts?',a:'Women\'s testimony is accepted in numerous legal matters. The judge evaluates the reliability and knowledge of all witnesses regardless of gender. In the Islamic Republic\'s judicial system, women serve in various judicial roles including as legal advisors and in family courts.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['women','testimony','witnesses','court','gender']},
{id:'jd010',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Disputes',marja:'sistani',q:'How should disputes between Muslims be resolved?',a:'Islam encourages resolution in this order: (1) Direct negotiation and reconciliation between parties, (2) Mediation by a trusted third party or family members, (3) Arbitration by a knowledgeable person agreed upon by both parties, (4) Formal adjudication by a qualified mujtahid or his representative. Taking disputes to non-Islamic courts is problematic except when necessary (no Islamic court available) or when required by law. Reconciliation (sulh) is always preferable to formal judgment.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['disputes','reconciliation','mediation','court','arbitration']},
{id:'jd011',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Disputes',marja:'khamenei',q:'How should disputes between Muslims be resolved?',a:'Muslims should first attempt reconciliation. The Quran encourages peacemaking: "Reconciliation is best" (4:128). If that fails, qualified religious scholars can arbitrate. In countries with Islamic judiciary, the court system handles disputes. In non-Muslim countries, Muslims may use local courts when Islamic arbitration is unavailable, while seeking Islamic guidance for religious dimensions.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['disputes','reconciliation','mediation','court','arbitration']},
{id:'jd012',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Disputes',marja:'noori',q:'How should disputes between Muslims be resolved?',a:'The Prophet (s) and Imams (as) consistently encouraged reconciliation. Imam Ali (as) said: "I would not leave reconciliation between two people even for the equivalent of everything in this world." Disputes should be resolved with justice and compassion. Community leaders and scholars should facilitate mediation before matters escalate to formal proceedings.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['disputes','reconciliation','mediation','court','arbitration']},
{id:'jd013',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Hudud',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the hudud punishments and when do they apply?',a:'Hudud are fixed punishments prescribed by Quran and Sunnah for specific crimes: theft, adultery, false accusation of adultery, highway robbery, apostasy (debated), and consuming intoxicants. However, their application has extremely strict evidence requirements — for example, adultery requires four just male eyewitnesses to the actual act. During the occultation of the Imam (as), many scholars hold that hudud are suspended or severely restricted. The emphasis is on repentance and rehabilitation.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hudud','punishment','evidence','crime','justice']},
{id:'jd014',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Hudud',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the hudud punishments and when do they apply?',a:'Hudud exist as a deterrent framework within a comprehensive Islamic legal system. Their implementation requires an Islamic government and full judicial process. The evidence standards are intentionally very high to make their actual application rare. The purpose is social deterrence, not widespread punishment. Many cases are resolved through tawbah (repentance) before reaching the hudud threshold.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hudud','punishment','evidence','crime','justice']},
{id:'jd015',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Hudud',marja:'hakim',q:'What are the hudud punishments and when do they apply?',a:'The hudud framework demonstrates Islamic law\'s hierarchy: prevention first (education, social support), then lesser penalties, with hudud as a last resort for the most serious offenses. The conditions for application are so stringent that in practice, alternative punishments (ta\'zirat) are far more common. The judge has significant discretion in many cases.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['hudud','punishment','evidence','crime','justice']},

{id:'jd016',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the basic human rights in Islamic law?',a:'Islamic law guarantees fundamental rights: (1) Right to life — killing is among the greatest sins, (2) Right to dignity — the Quran honors all children of Adam (17:70), (3) Right to property — theft and usurpation are major sins, (4) Right to privacy — spying is forbidden (49:12), (5) Right to justice — even against oneself (4:135), (6) Right to religious freedom — no compulsion in religion (2:256), (7) Right to knowledge and education, (8) Right to family and marriage, (9) Right to work and fair wages. These rights are divinely ordained, not granted by governments.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['human rights','justice','dignity','freedom','equality']},
{id:'jd017',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the basic human rights in Islamic law?',a:'Human rights in Islam are rooted in divine mandate, not social contract. Key rights include: life, dignity, equality before the law, freedom of thought and belief, property, privacy, education, work, health, family, and justice. Imam Ali\'s letter to Malik al-Ashtar outlines a comprehensive charter of governance rights. Islamic human rights are universal — they apply to Muslims and non-Muslims alike living under Islamic governance.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['human rights','justice','dignity','freedom','equality']},
{id:'jd018',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Rights',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the basic human rights in Islamic law?',a:'Islam established comprehensive human rights 1400 years before modern declarations. The Quran establishes: equality of humanity (49:13), prohibition of oppression, right to justice, right to privacy, right to life, prohibition of torture, freedom from compulsion in religion, right to property, and right to family. Imam Ali\'s governance in Kufa demonstrated these principles in practice — he ensured rights for all citizens regardless of religion, race, or social status.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['human rights','justice','dignity','freedom','equality']},
{id:'jd019',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Arbitration',marja:'sistani',q:'How does Islamic arbitration work?',a:'Islamic arbitration (tahkim) involves both parties agreeing to accept the judgment of a chosen arbiter. The arbiter should be: knowledgeable in Islamic law, just, and impartial. Both parties present their evidence, and the arbiter issues a ruling that is binding once accepted. In family disputes, the Quran specifically recommends appointing arbiters from each family (4:35). Modern Islamic arbitration centers serve this function in many countries.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['arbitration','tahkim','dispute','arbiter','resolution']},
{id:'jd020',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Arbitration',marja:'khamenei',q:'How does Islamic arbitration work?',a:'Arbitration is preferred over formal litigation as it preserves relationships and privacy. The process: parties agree on an arbiter, present their cases, and accept the outcome. The arbiter should apply Islamic principles of justice. In international commerce, Islamic arbitration clauses are increasingly common and recognized by many legal systems. This serves as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['arbitration','tahkim','dispute','arbiter','resolution']},
{id:'jd021',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Arbitration',marja:'hakim',q:'How does Islamic arbitration work?',a:'The arbitration tradition in Shia Islam goes back to Imam Ali (as), who accepted arbitration even in political matters. The process emphasizes: voluntary participation, competent arbiters, fair hearing, and commitment to justice. Arbitration is generally faster, less costly, and less adversarial than formal court proceedings, making it ideal for community disputes.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['arbitration','tahkim','dispute','arbiter','resolution']},
{id:'jd022',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Confession',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules regarding confessions?',a:'Confession (iqrar) is one of the strongest forms of evidence. Rules: (1) The confessor must be adult, sane, and acting voluntarily, (2) A confession made under torture, threat, or coercion is completely invalid, (3) A person can retract their confession in hudud cases (and the retraction should be accepted), (4) Repeated voluntary confession has more legal weight, (5) Confession in one matter cannot be extended to unrelated matters. The judge should create an environment where confessions are genuinely voluntary.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['confession','iqrar','voluntary','coercion','evidence']},
{id:'jd023',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Confession',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules regarding confessions?',a:'The validity of confession requires absolute voluntariness. Any sign of coercion invalidates it entirely. In the Islamic judicial system, the judge must verify that the confession is free, informed, and deliberate. Leading questions that manipulate the accused into confessing are not acceptable. The right against self-incrimination is protected in cases where retraction is possible.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['confession','iqrar','voluntary','coercion','evidence']},
{id:'jd024',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Confession',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rules regarding confessions?',a:'Islam protects the accused from forced confession. The famous hadith "idra\'u al-hudud bil-shubuhat" (avert punishments through ambiguities) shows the system\'s preference for mercy. If there is any doubt about whether a confession was coerced, the benefit of doubt goes to the accused. Confessions should be verified against other evidence when possible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['confession','iqrar','voluntary','coercion','evidence']},
{id:'jd025',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Rights of Accused',marja:'sistani',q:'What rights does an accused person have?',a:'The accused has extensive rights: (1) Presumption of innocence until proven guilty, (2) Right to remain silent and not self-incriminate, (3) Right to present evidence and witnesses in their defense, (4) Right to legal representation or counsel, (5) Protection from torture and coercion, (6) Right to a fair and impartial judge, (7) Right to appeal. Imam Ali (as) established many of these principles 1400 years ago in his judicial directives.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['accused','rights','innocence','defense','justice']},
{id:'jd026',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Rights of Accused',marja:'khamenei',q:'What rights does an accused person have?',a:'Islamic criminal justice provides robust protections: presumption of innocence, right to defense, protection from double jeopardy, prohibition of torture, right to a speedy trial, and the principle that doubt favors the accused. These rights are divinely ordained, not granted by the state — they cannot be suspended even in emergencies.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['accused','rights','innocence','defense','justice']},
{id:'jd027',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Rights of Accused',marja:'hakim',q:'What rights does an accused person have?',a:'The rights of the accused reflect Islam\'s commitment to justice. Imam Ali (as) in his instructions to judges emphasized: never rush to judgment, hear both sides fully, treat parties equally (even in seating arrangement), and when in doubt, rule in favor of the accused. These principles predate modern human rights frameworks by many centuries.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['accused','rights','innocence','defense','justice']},
{id:'jd028',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Restitution',marja:'sistani',q:'How does the concept of diyah (blood money) work?',a:'Diyah is financial compensation paid for: homicide (full diyah), injuries (partial diyah proportional to severity), and other physical harms. For intentional killing, the victim\'s family can choose: (1) Qisas (retribution), (2) Diyah (blood money), (3) Forgiveness. The amount of full diyah is traditionally calculated in gold, silver, or livestock equivalents. Diyah for a woman is half that of a man in the classical view, though modern scholars discuss this. Diyah serves both as compensation and deterrent.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['diyah','blood money','compensation','qisas','restitution']},
{id:'jd029',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Restitution',marja:'khamenei',q:'How does the concept of diyah (blood money) work?',a:'Diyah provides economic justice for victims while offering an alternative to retribution. The amounts are updated periodically by judicial authorities to reflect current economic values. The option of forgiveness with diyah promotes reconciliation. In Iran, the Supreme Court sets annual diyah rates. Insurance coverage for accidental diyah obligations is recommended.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['diyah','blood money','compensation','qisas','restitution']},
{id:'jd030',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Restitution',marja:'makarem',q:'How does the concept of diyah (blood money) work?',a:'The diyah system balances justice and mercy. It compensates victims while allowing the offender to make amends financially rather than facing physical punishment. For accidental injuries or death, diyah is the primary remedy — there is no qisas for unintentional harm. The system encourages victims\' families to choose forgiveness, which the Quran praises as better than retaliation.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['diyah','blood money','compensation','qisas','restitution']},
{id:'jd031',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Testimony',marja:'sistani',q:'What disqualifies a witness from testifying?',a:'A witness is disqualified if: (1) They lack \'adalah (justice/uprightness) — known for major sins or persistent minor sins, (2) They have a personal interest in the outcome, (3) They have enmity toward one of the parties, (4) They are insane or minor, (5) They are known liars. Close family relationships (parent-child, spouses) may affect the weight of testimony. The judge evaluates witness credibility holistically, considering consistency, reputation, and demeanor.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['witness','disqualification','credibility','adalah','testimony']},
{id:'jd032',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Testimony',marja:'makarem',q:'What disqualifies a witness from testifying?',a:'Witness credibility is fundamental to justice. Disqualifiers include: known dishonesty, personal stake in the case, grudges, mental incompetence, and reputation for sinfulness. The concept of adalah (justice) for witnesses means they must be generally truthful, religiously observant, and of good character. A single disqualifier can invalidate testimony. The judge bears the heavy responsibility of evaluating witness reliability.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['witness','disqualification','credibility','adalah','testimony']},
{id:'jd033',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Modern Courts',marja:'sistani',q:'Can Muslims use non-Islamic courts?',a:'Using non-Islamic courts is permissible when: (1) No Islamic court or arbitration is available, (2) The local law requires it (property disputes, divorce, etc.), (3) Rights cannot be recovered otherwise. Muslims should first try Islamic dispute resolution if available. When using secular courts, the outcome should be evaluated against Islamic law — if the court\'s ruling violates Islamic rights, the Islamic ruling remains morally binding even if legally superseded.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['secular courts','non-islamic','legal system','necessity','arbitration']},
{id:'jd034',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Modern Courts',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can Muslims use non-Islamic courts?',a:'In non-Muslim countries, Muslims may use the legal system available to them. This is a practical necessity, not a religious endorsement. However, Muslims should: establish Islamic arbitration options in their communities, consult scholars about the Islamic dimensions of their cases, and comply with local laws while maintaining Islamic ethical standards.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['secular courts','non-islamic','legal system','necessity','arbitration']},
{id:'jd035',cat:'judiciary',sub:'Modern Courts',marja:'makarem',q:'Can Muslims use non-Islamic courts?',a:'Pragmatism is required. Muslims living under non-Islamic legal systems should use available courts for legitimate needs. Having Islamic arbitration as a supplementary option is ideal. Community organizations should develop accessible Islamic dispute resolution services. When a secular court ruling conflicts with Islamic law, consult a scholar about how to proceed ethically.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['secular courts','non-islamic','legal system','necessity','arbitration']},
