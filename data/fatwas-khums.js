{id:'kh001',cat:'khums',sub:'Obligation',marja:'sistani',q:'What is khums and when is it obligatory?',a:'Khums is an Islamic tax of one-fifth (20%) that must be paid on certain categories of income and wealth. It is obligatory on: (1) Profit from business, trade, employment, and any earnings after deducting annual living expenses. (2) Minerals extracted from the earth. (3) Treasure (rikaz) found. (4) Precious items obtained by diving in the sea. (5) Lawful wealth mixed with unlawful wealth that cannot be separated. (6) Land purchased by a dhimmi from a Muslim. (7) Spoils of war. For most people, the primary application is annual surplus income — whatever remains from earnings after a year of reasonable expenses.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 1, Khums',tags:['khums','obligation','fifth','income']},
{id:'kh002',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'sistani',q:'How is the khums year (sanah khumsiyyah) calculated?',a:'Each person establishes a khums year beginning from the date they first earn income in their profession or business. At the end of this year, they calculate total income minus legitimate annual expenses (food, housing, clothing, transportation, medical, education, etc.). 20% of the remaining surplus is owed as khums. The person can set any date as their annual khums date and maintain it consistently. Common choices include the first day of their job, the beginning of Ramadan, or any fixed date. Once established, this date should be maintained each year.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1736',tags:['khums','year','calculation','date']},
{id:'kh003',cat:'khums',sub:'Exemptions',marja:'khamenei',q:'What expenses are deducted before calculating khums?',a:'All reasonable annual living expenses (mu\'nah) are deducted before calculating khums. These include: rent or mortgage payments, food and groceries, clothing, transportation, medical expenses, education costs, insurance, utilities, reasonable gifts given, charity donations, religious dues (like zakat), debts paid during the year, wedding expenses, household furnishings purchased and used during the year, and expenses for dependents. The standard is what is customary (\'urfi) for a person of that social standing — neither extravagant nor miserly. Business expenses for earning income are also deducted.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','deductions','expenses','munah']},
{id:'kh004',cat:'khums',sub:'Distribution',marja:'sistani',q:'How is khums distributed?',a:'Khums is divided into two equal halves: (1) Sahm al-Imam (Share of the Imam) — 50% goes to the Imam of the time (currently in occultation). In his absence, it is given to the Marja al-Taqlid or his authorized representative to be spent on promoting Islam, Islamic education, supporting scholars, and other purposes the Imam would approve. (2) Sahm al-Sadat (Share of the Sayyids) — 50% is given to needy, orphaned, or stranded Sayyids (descendants of the Prophet). The Sayyid recipients must be Shia Ithna-Ashari and genuinely in need. It is recommended to distribute through the Marja or his representative.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Khums distribution',tags:['khums','distribution','sahm','imam','sadat']},
{id:'kh005',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is khums obligatory on salary before or after tax?',a:'Khums is calculated on the net amount that the person actually receives and has authority over. Government taxes that are deducted at source (income tax, social security) are considered expenses and are deducted before khums calculation. If the person receives a tax refund, that refund is considered income for the year it is received. The principle is that khums applies to what remains after all legitimate expenses, and mandatory taxes are legitimate expenses. Voluntary retirement savings (like pension contributions) are also typically deductible as they are not freely accessible during the year.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','salary','tax','net','calculation']},
{id:'kh006',cat:'khums',sub:'Property',marja:'sistani',q:'Is khums due on the family home?',a:'If a person purchases a home for personal residence using that year\'s income, and the purchase is considered appropriate to their social standing (not extravagant), it is counted as annual expenditure (mu\'nah) and khums is not due on it. However, if the home is purchased as an investment property, for rental income, or is beyond what is appropriate for one\'s standing, khums would be due on the surplus/investment portion. If a person builds a home over multiple years, each year\'s payments from that year\'s income are considered mu\'nah. Property that appreciates in value — the appreciation is only subject to khums if/when sold.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['khums','home','property','munah','residence']},
{id:'kh007',cat:'khums',sub:'Property',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is khums obligatory on gold jewelry?',a:'Gold jewelry purchased for personal use (wearing) is considered part of annual expenses (mu\'nah) if it is appropriate to one\'s social standing and was bought from that year\'s income. In this case, no khums is due. However, jewelry purchased as an investment or savings (not worn regularly) is considered surplus wealth and khums must be paid on it. Inherited jewelry has no khums obligation. If jewelry was purchased from pre-khums income (before establishing a khums year or from income on which khums was not yet paid), khums must be paid on its value.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','jewelry','gold','women','investment']},
{id:'kh008',cat:'khums',sub:'Obligation',marja:'shirazi',q:'Does a student who has no income need to pay khums?',a:'A student who has no independent income is not obligated to pay khums on their own. If they receive money from parents for living expenses and spend it all on legitimate expenses within the year, there is no surplus and thus no khums. However, if a student receives gifts, scholarships, or savings that exceed their annual expenses, khums would be due on the surplus. If parents give them money that has already had khums paid on it, there is no double obligation. Student loans are debts, not income, so khums is not due on loan amounts — but once the student earns and repays, the earning/expense calculations apply normally.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','student','income','scholarship','loan']},
{id:'kh009',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'sistani',q:'How is khums calculated on savings and bank accounts?',a:'At the khums year-end date, any money in savings accounts, bank accounts, or cash holdings that exceeds annual expenses is subject to khums (20%). If money in the account has already had khums paid on it (from previous years), only the new additions and interest/profit earned are subject to khums. Bank interest/profit is treated as income for the year it is credited. Fixed deposits that mature after the khums date — the amount is still subject to khums in the year it was deposited if it was surplus income. One should keep records of what has been "khums-cleared" (mukhammis) to avoid double-payment.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','savings','bank','interest','calculation']},
{id:'kh010',cat:'khums',sub:'Obligation',marja:'wahid',q:'Is khums obligatory on inheritance?',a:'No, khums is not obligatory on inherited wealth, whether it is money, property, or goods. Inheritance is not considered "earned income" or "profit." However, any profit or income generated from inherited assets (such as rental income from inherited property, or returns from investing inherited money) is subject to khums like any other income. If inherited money is invested in a business, the profits from that business are subject to khums in the normal way. The original inherited capital remains exempt.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['khums','inheritance','exempt','profit']},
{id:'kh011',cat:'khums',sub:'Obligation',marja:'najafi',q:'Is khums due on mahr (dowry) received by a wife?',a:'Mahr received by a wife is not subject to khums as it is considered a gift/right rather than earned income in the traditional sense. However, this is a matter where scholars have slightly different views. The predominant opinion is that mahr, whether received in cash or kind, is like a gift and is exempt from khums. But if the mahr money is saved and generates profit, or if it remains unspent past the khums year-end and is considered surplus wealth, some scholars apply khums to the surplus portion. It is advisable to consult one\'s specific marja for this nuanced issue.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','mahr','dowry','women','gift']},
{id:'kh012',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'hakim',q:'What happens if someone has never paid khums on past years?',a:'A person who has not paid khums for multiple years is still obligated for all past years. They should calculate the surplus from each year retroactively and pay the owed khums. If exact calculation is impossible, they should estimate reasonably and generously. For items purchased with money on which khums was not paid (furniture, car, etc.), khums is due on their current value or purchase price, whichever the marja specifies. It is recommended to consult a scholar or the marja\'s representative to arrange a practical settlement plan. Some marjas allow installment payments of past khums dues to avoid excessive hardship.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['khums','past','missed','calculation','retroactive']},
{id:'kh013',cat:'khums',sub:'Property',marja:'sistani',q:'Is khums due on a car used for personal transportation?',a:'If a car is purchased for personal use (commuting, family transportation) and is appropriate to one\'s social and financial standing, it is considered mu\'nah (annual expense) and khums is not due on it — provided it was purchased during the khums year from that year\'s income. If the car is purchased as a luxury beyond one\'s means or standard, khums would apply to the amount exceeding what is customary. A second car kept as a spare or for investment purposes would be subject to khums. A car used for business (taxi, delivery) — its purchase is a business expense, and business profit is subject to khums.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','car','vehicle','personal','munah']},
{id:'kh014',cat:'khums',sub:'Obligation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is khums due on cryptocurrency profits?',a:'Yes, profits from cryptocurrency trading are considered income from trade/business and are subject to khums. At the end of the khums year, the net profit (total portfolio value minus initial investment minus expenses) that exceeds annual living expenses is subject to 20% khums. If cryptocurrencies are held as savings/investment and their value has increased, the unrealized gain is subject to khums based on the current market value at the khums year-end date. If the value decreases after paying khums, the loss cannot be reclaimed from previously paid khums but can offset future gains.',source:'Istifta\'at Jadid',tags:['khums','cryptocurrency','bitcoin','profit','digital']},
{id:'kh015',cat:'khums',sub:'Distribution',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one pay khums directly to a needy Sayyid or must it go through the marja?',a:'For the Sahm al-Sadat (the half designated for needy Sayyids), it is permissible to pay directly to qualifying Sayyids — those who are Shia, poor, orphaned, or stranded travelers. However, as an obligatory precaution, one should obtain permission from the marja or his representative before distributing it directly, to ensure proper allocation. For Sahm al-Imam, it must be given to the marja or his authorized representative. Many marjas prefer that both shares be channeled through their offices to ensure proper and beneficial distribution.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','distribution','sayyid','marja','permission']},
{id:'kh016',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'hamedani',q:'Are gifts received subject to khums?',a:'Gifts received are subject to khums if they remain unspent and form part of the surplus at the end of the khums year. If a gift is received and used during the year for legitimate expenses, no khums is due. However, if the gift (whether cash, goods, or property) remains as surplus at the year-end, it is included in the khums calculation. Small customary gifts that are consumed (food, sweets) within the year are naturally exempt as they are used up. Large gifts like property or vehicles — if used as personal mu\'nah appropriate to one\'s standing, they may be exempt; otherwise khums applies.',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah',tags:['khums','gifts','surplus','calculation']},
{id:'km017',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'sistani',q:'How is khums calculated on savings?',a:'Khums on annual savings: (1) Set a fixed date as your "khums year" anniversary. (2) On that date, calculate: all income minus all reasonable expenses of the past year. (3) Pay 20% of the net surplus. Expenses include: rent/mortgage, food, clothing, education, medical, transportation, charity, debts, gifts, and reasonable entertainment. Capital assets used for livelihood (tools, business equipment) are exempt. Goods purchased but unused (stockpiled food, extra clothes) are subject to khums.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','calculation','savings','surplus','annual','expenses']},
{id:'km018',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'khamenei',q:'How is khums calculated on savings?',a:'The khums calculation requires honest self-assessment. On your annual date: total all income sources (salary, business profit, investments, gifts received), subtract all legitimate annual expenses, and pay 20% of the remainder. Business khums is on net profit after deducting costs. If you have assets that gained value (real estate, stocks), the gain is subject to khums. Debts owed to you count as potential income when collected.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','calculation','savings','surplus','annual','expenses']},
{id:'km019',cat:'khums',sub:'Calculation',marja:'makarem',q:'How is khums calculated on savings?',a:'Practical khums calculation guide: (1) Choose a date (many use 1st Ramadan or their birthday). (2) List everything you earned this year. (3) List everything you spent on living expenses. (4) The difference is your surplus — pay 20% as khums. (5) Items purchased during the year but not consumed (extra food, unused clothes, savings in any form) are all part of the surplus. (6) If you have a home loan, the payments made this year count as expenses, but the equity gained may be subject to khums on the increased value.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','calculation','savings','surplus','annual','expenses']},
{id:'km020',cat:'khums',sub:'Modern',marja:'sistani',q:'Is khums required on salary income?',a:'Yes, khums applies to salary income — specifically, what remains unspent from the annual salary at the end of one\'s khums year. The gross salary is subject to khums after deducting: taxes paid, work-related expenses, and all personal/family living expenses for the year. This means if your annual salary is $60,000, taxes take $15,000, and living expenses are $40,000, then $5,000 is subject to khums = $1,000 payment.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','salary','income','calculation','modern']},
{id:'km021',cat:'khums',sub:'Modern',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is khums required on salary income?',a:'Salary is the most common income source subject to khums. The ruling is clear: at the end of your khums year, whatever remains from salary (and all other income) after legitimate annual expenses is taxable at 20%. Government-mandated taxes are deducted before khums calculation. Retirement contributions are debated — voluntary retirement savings may be subject to khums, while mandatory pension deductions are generally treated as taxes.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','salary','income','calculation','modern']},
{id:'km022',cat:'khums',sub:'Modern',marja:'safi',q:'Is khums required on salary income?',a:'All forms of earned income — salary, wages, freelance earnings, bonuses — are subject to khums. The year-end calculation approach makes it manageable: you don\'t pay khums from each paycheck, but rather on whatever accumulates by your khums date. If you spend your entire income each year with nothing left, no khums is due. The obligation arises only on surplus — Islam does not tax those living paycheck to paycheck.',source:'Hidayat al-Ibad / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','salary','income','calculation','modern']},
{id:'km023',cat:'khums',sub:'Modern',marja:'sistani',q:'Is khums required on investments and stocks?',a:'Investment profits are subject to khums. Scenarios: (1) Stock appreciation — if you bought shares for $10,000 and they\'re worth $15,000 at your khums date, the $5,000 gain is subject to khums if realized or if you could readily liquidate. (2) Dividends — treated as income, subject to khums after expenses. (3) Real estate investment — rental income is taxable; property value appreciation is subject to khums when sold. (4) Business inventory — valued at current market price minus purchase cost; profit portion has khums.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','investment','stocks','profit','cryptocurrency']},
{id:'km024',cat:'khums',sub:'Modern',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is khums required on investments and stocks?',a:'Investments of all kinds are subject to khums on their profits. Cryptocurrency gains are treated the same as stock market gains — the profit is subject to khums. For unrealized gains (stock you haven\'t sold), there is a scholarly discussion: some require khums on paper gains, others only on realized gains. The safer approach is to pay on current market value. Gold and silver held as investment (not personal jewelry) are subject to khums on value increase.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','investment','stocks','profit','cryptocurrency']},
{id:'km025',cat:'khums',sub:'Modern',marja:'makarem',q:'Is khums required on investments and stocks?',a:'Modern investment khums: the principle is straightforward — 20% on net profit from any investment. Stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrency, business ventures — all follow the same rule. Losses in one investment can offset gains in another within the same khums year. If your portfolio lost money overall this year, no khums is due on investments. Capital gains taxes paid to the government are deducted before calculating khums.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','investment','stocks','profit','cryptocurrency']},
{id:'km026',cat:'khums',sub:'Distribution',marja:'sistani',q:'How is khums distributed?',a:'Khums is divided into two equal halves: (1) Sahm al-Imam — the share of the 12th Imam (as). During the occultation, this is given to the marja al-taqlid or his authorized representative to spend on Islamic causes: seminaries, religious education, propagation of Islam, supporting scholars, publishing, and helping the needy among Sayyids. (2) Sahm al-Sadah — the share of the descendants of the Prophet (Sayyids/Hashemites) who are needy. This is given to poor Sayyids for their living expenses.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khums','distribution','imam','sadah','marja','sayyid']},
{id:'km027',cat:'khums',sub:'Distribution',marja:'khamenei',q:'How is khums distributed?',a:'Sahm al-Imam goes to the Wali al-Faqih (or the marja one follows) for distribution in Islamic public interest: religious institutions, education, humanitarian aid, defense of Islam. Sahm al-Sadah goes to needy Sayyids — descendants of Banu Hashim who are poor. The payer can sometimes distribute Sahm al-Sadah directly to qualifying Sayyids with the marja\'s permission. For Sahm al-Imam, it must go through the marja or his authorized representative.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','distribution','imam','sadah','marja','sayyid']},
{id:'km028',cat:'khums',sub:'Distribution',marja:'makarem',q:'How is khums distributed?',a:'The two-part distribution: half to the Imam\'s representative (your marja) for religious and community needs, half to needy Sayyids. In practice: most marjas have offices and representatives worldwide who collect and distribute khums. Many also have online payment systems. If you want to direct your khums to specific projects (building a school, supporting orphans), ask your marja\'s office — they often accommodate such requests from the Sahm al-Imam portion.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['khums','distribution','imam','sadah','marja','sayyid']},

Expenses include: food, housing, clothing, transportation, education, medical, gifts given, charity, debts paid, and all reasonable living costs.

Khums is 20% of this surplus. Setting a fixed annual date is important for consistent calculation. Business assets, inventory, and equipment used in business are treated differently — consult your Marja\'s detailed rulings. The khums year begins from first earning.

Subtract what you had at the start of the year. Pay 20% of the increase. For first-time payers: calculate the total value of all savings and unused goods currently, and pay 20% on that.
