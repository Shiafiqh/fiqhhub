{id:'tr001',cat:'trade',sub:'General Rules',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the basic conditions for a valid sale (bay\')?',a:'A valid sale requires: (1) Offer and acceptance (ijab and qabul) — verbal, written, or by conduct (mu\'atah). (2) Both parties must be sane, baligh, and acting of free will. (3) The seller must have ownership or authorization to sell. (4) The item must be specified and known to both parties. (5) The price must be specified. (6) The item must be deliverable. (7) The item must have legitimate shariah value — selling wine, pork, or items with no benefit is invalid. (8) The item must be tahir in itself (for items where taharah is a condition). (9) The transaction must not involve riba (usury/interest). A sale conducted through modern means (online, card transactions) is valid if these conditions are met.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2, Kitab al-Bay\'',tags:['trade','sale','conditions','validity','bay']},
{id:'tr002',cat:'trade',sub:'Riba',marja:'sistani',q:'What is riba and why is it prohibited?',a:'Riba (usury/interest) is prohibited in two forms: (1) Riba in transactions (riba al-mu\'amalah) — exchanging the same type of weighed or measured commodity with excess (e.g., 1kg wheat for 1.5kg wheat). This applies even without a time delay. (2) Riba in loans (riba al-qard) — any stipulated excess in repaying a loan (lending $100 with the condition of repaying $110). Any loan where excess is stipulated is riba, regardless of the rate. Riba is among the most severe sins — narrations equate it with worse than fornication. The prohibition aims to prevent exploitation and wealth hoarding. Legitimate profit from trade and investment is entirely different from riba.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Riba section',tags:['riba','usury','interest','prohibition','loan']},
{id:'tr003',cat:'trade',sub:'Insurance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islam?',a:'Insurance contracts are permissible as they constitute a legitimate agreement where one party pays a premium in exchange for coverage against specified risks. This can be classified as a type of contractual agreement (sulh or mu\'awadah) that does not contradict shariah principles. Life insurance, health insurance, car insurance, property insurance, and business insurance are all permissible. The premiums paid are halal expenses, and the payouts received upon valid claims are halal income. However, insurance companies\' investment of funds in interest-bearing accounts is a separate issue — the policyholder is not responsible for how the company invests.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['insurance','permissible','contract','halal']},
{id:'tr004',cat:'trade',sub:'Employment',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to work for a non-Muslim employer?',a:'Working for a non-Muslim employer is permissible as long as: (1) The work itself is halal (not producing alcohol, pork products, gambling services, or other haram activities). (2) The work does not cause harm to Muslims or the Islamic community. (3) The worker is not compelled to commit haram acts. (4) The worker can fulfill their religious obligations (prayer, fasting, etc.). Working in mixed environments with non-Muslims is normal and acceptable. The income earned from halal work is halal regardless of the employer\'s religion. Many Muslims throughout history have worked in diverse professional environments.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['employment','non-Muslim','work','halal','income']},
{id:'tr005',cat:'trade',sub:'Riba',marja:'sistani',q:'Is bank interest/profit on savings accounts permissible?',a:'Conventional bank interest (where the bank guarantees a fixed return on deposits) is a form of riba and is haram if stipulated as a condition. However, many scholars distinguish between: (1) Islamic banks that operate on profit-sharing (mudarabah) — returns from these are halal as they represent a share of actual profits. (2) Conventional banks in Muslim countries where the government has designated the returns as halal — some marjas allow this. (3) Conventional banks in non-Muslim countries — there is a view that riba restrictions may differ with non-Muslim entities. As an obligatory precaution, one should deposit money without stipulating interest, and if the bank pays returns, receive them as profit-sharing or unknown income.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['bank','interest','savings','riba','halal']},
{id:'tr006',cat:'trade',sub:'Stock Market',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is investing in the stock market permissible?',a:'Investing in stocks is permissible with conditions: (1) The company\'s primary business must be halal — not alcohol, gambling, conventional banking (interest-based), pork, weapons of mass destruction, etc. (2) The investor should not buy stocks in companies whose main revenue is from haram activities. (3) Day-trading that resembles gambling (pure speculation without fundamental analysis) is questionable. (4) Short-selling (selling stocks you don\'t own) has scholarly debate around it. (5) If a generally halal company has minor haram income (e.g., interest on deposits), many scholars permit investing while avoiding the proportional haram amount from dividends. Index funds require examination of their constituent companies.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['stocks','investment','halal','market','shares']},
{id:'tr007',cat:'trade',sub:'General Rules',marja:'hakim',q:'What is a valid contract of lease (ijarah)?',a:'Ijarah (lease/rent) is a contract where one party provides the use of property or their labor/services for a specified period in exchange for agreed compensation. Conditions: (1) The subject must be specified — what is being rented and for how long. (2) The rental amount must be specified. (3) The use must be halal. (4) The lessor must own or be authorized to lease the property. (5) The property must be usable for the intended purpose. (6) Both parties must be sane and baligh. Ijarah applies to renting homes, hiring workers, leasing equipment, and professional services. If the leased item is damaged without the lessee\'s negligence, the lessor bears the loss.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['ijarah','lease','rent','contract','conditions']},
{id:'tr008',cat:'trade',sub:'Cheating',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on cheating or deception in business?',a:'Cheating (ghish) and deception (tadlis) in business transactions are strictly haram. This includes: (1) Hiding defects in merchandise. (2) Mixing inferior goods with superior ones. (3) False advertising or misrepresentation. (4) Short-weighing or short-measuring. (5) Manipulating prices through hoarding or monopolistic practices. (6) Selling counterfeit goods as genuine. The Prophet (s) said: "Whoever cheats us is not one of us." If a buyer discovers they were cheated, they have the right to cancel the transaction (khiyar al-\'ayb/ghaban). The seller must also actively disclose known defects — silence about a defect is itself deception.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['cheating','deception','business','ethics','ghish']},
{id:'tr009',cat:'trade',sub:'Modern Finance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is cryptocurrency trading halal?',a:'Cryptocurrency trading is permissible if the following conditions are met: (1) The cryptocurrency has legitimate value and utility in the market. (2) The trading does not involve gambling-like speculation. (3) The platform and exchange are legitimate. (4) The trade complies with local laws. (5) The cryptocurrency is not primarily used for illegal activities. Mining cryptocurrency using one\'s own equipment and electricity is also permissible as it is a form of legitimate earning. However, pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes disguised as crypto projects are haram. Profits from crypto trading are subject to khums.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','halal','digital']},
{id:'tr010',cat:'trade',sub:'Employment',marja:'wahid',q:'Is it permissible to work in a restaurant that serves haram food?',a:'Working in a restaurant that serves haram food depends on one\'s role: (1) Cooking, preparing, or serving pork is not permissible. (2) Serving alcohol or pouring it for customers is not permissible. (3) Working in roles that do not directly involve handling haram items (cashier, cleaning, management of halal sections) is permissible when there is genuine need, though it is better to seek alternative employment. (4) Working in a restaurant that serves some haram items among mostly halal food — the income from one\'s general labor is halal, but one should avoid directly handling haram products. The income earned is not haram if one\'s specific tasks are halal.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['work','restaurant','haram food','alcohol','serving']},
{id:'tr011',cat:'trade',sub:'Debt',marja:'najafi',q:'What are the Islamic rules for lending and borrowing?',a:'Lending (qard) is highly recommended and its reward is immense. Rules include: (1) The lender cannot stipulate any excess or benefit in return — this would be riba. (2) The loan should be documented and witnessed (Quran 2:282). (3) The borrower is obligated to repay. (4) It is haram to delay repayment when one has the ability to pay. (5) If the borrower gives a gift voluntarily (not pre-agreed) at repayment time, it is permissible. (6) The lender should not pressure the borrower in hardship. (7) Lending with a condition of providing a service or benefit in return is not permissible. (8) It is permissible to require collateral (rahn) for a loan.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['lending','borrowing','debt','riba','rules']},
{id:'tr012',cat:'trade',sub:'General Rules',marja:'makarem',q:'Is hoarding goods to raise prices permissible?',a:'Hoarding essential goods (ihtikar) to create artificial scarcity and raise prices is haram. This applies particularly to food staples: wheat, barley, rice, oil, salt, and other essential items that people need. If a seller buys essential goods when people are in need, solely to hold them and sell at inflated prices, this is sinful hoarding. The Islamic ruler/government has the right to compel hoarders to release their goods at fair prices. However, storing goods for personal use, or holding non-essential goods, or legitimate business inventory management, is not prohibited hoarding.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hoarding','ihtikar','prices','haram','essential']},
{id:'tr013',cat:'trade',sub:'Online Business',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for online selling and e-commerce?',a:'Online selling follows the same principles as in-person transactions: (1) The product must be clearly described — photos and descriptions must accurately represent the item, (2) The price must be agreed upon, (3) Hidden defects must be disclosed, (4) Delivery terms should be clear, (5) Both parties have the right to cancel (khiyar) if the product differs from its description. Dropshipping is permissible if the buyer is informed they are purchasing from a reseller. Selling haram products online is the same as selling them in person — forbidden.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['online','e-commerce','selling','trade','digital','business']},
{id:'tr014',cat:'trade',sub:'Online Business',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules for online selling and e-commerce?',a:'E-commerce is a valid form of trade. The Quran says: "O you who believe, do not consume each other\'s wealth unjustly, but let there be trade by mutual consent" (4:29). This applies to online transactions. Important: accurate product representation, honest reviews, clear return policies, and prompt delivery are all Islamic commercial ethics. Digital products (software, courses, ebooks) are valid commodities for sale. Fake reviews and misleading advertising are forms of fraud — haram.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['online','e-commerce','selling','trade','digital','business']},
{id:'tr015',cat:'trade',sub:'Online Business',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rules for online selling and e-commerce?',a:'Online business is fully permissible and can be very beneficial. Islamic guidelines: be truthful in product descriptions, use actual photos, disclose all relevant information, offer fair return policies, and deliver as promised. The platform (Amazon, eBay, Shopify) is just a marketplace — the same ethics that apply in a physical shop apply online. Selling counterfeit goods, misleading about product origin, and bait-and-switch tactics are all haram forms of deception.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['online','e-commerce','selling','trade','digital','business']},
{id:'tr016',cat:'trade',sub:'Contracts',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the basic requirements for a valid Islamic contract?',a:'A valid contract (aqd) requires: (1) Offer (ijab) and acceptance (qabul) — verbal, written, or through recognized gestures, (2) Both parties must be adult, sane, and acting voluntarily, (3) The subject matter must be halal, known, and deliverable, (4) The price/exchange must be defined, (5) No element of gharar (excessive uncertainty) that could lead to dispute, (6) No coercion or exploitation (ghubn — grossly unfair pricing). Modern contracts (written agreements, digital signatures, click-through agreements) are valid forms of ijab and qabul.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['contract','aqd','requirements','valid','trade','agreement']},
{id:'tr017',cat:'trade',sub:'Contracts',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the basic requirements for a valid Islamic contract?',a:'Islamic contract law is sophisticated and covers modern scenarios well. The key principles: mutual consent, clarity of terms, halal subject matter, and fairness. Both parties have cancellation rights (khiyar) in various circumstances: defective goods, non-matching description, or immediate post-agreement regret (khiyar al-majlis — right to cancel while still in the meeting/session). Written documentation is strongly encouraged — the longest verse in the Quran (2:282) deals with documenting financial transactions.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['contract','aqd','requirements','valid','trade','agreement']},
{id:'tr018',cat:'trade',sub:'Monopoly',marja:'sistani',q:'Is monopolizing goods (hoarding) permissible?',a:'Hoarding essential goods (ihtikar) to artificially inflate prices is haram. This applies to staple foods and essential commodities that people need. The Prophet (s) said: "Whoever hoards food for forty days has disassociated from Allah and Allah has disassociated from him." If someone holds essential goods while people are in need and no one else has supply, they can be compelled to sell at fair market price. Non-essential luxury goods can be held for better prices — this is normal business.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['monopoly','hoarding','ihtikar','haram','prices','market']},
{id:'tr019',cat:'trade',sub:'Monopoly',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is monopolizing goods (hoarding) permissible?',a:'Market manipulation through hoarding is prohibited. This includes cornering the market on essential commodities, creating artificial scarcity, and price gouging during emergencies. Islamic economics aims for fair markets where prices reflect genuine supply and demand. The ruler/government has the right to intervene in markets to prevent exploitation: price controls on essentials, forced sale of hoarded goods, and anti-monopoly measures are all legitimate Islamic governance tools.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['monopoly','hoarding','ihtikar','haram','prices','market']},

{id:'tr020',cat:'trade',sub:'Halal Business',marja:'sistani',q:'What makes a business transaction halal?',a:'A halal transaction requires: (1) Both parties must be sane adults acting voluntarily, (2) The item must be halal and have legitimate value, (3) The price and terms must be clearly agreed, (4) No fraud, deception, or hidden defects, (5) No riba (interest), (6) No excessive gharar (uncertainty), (7) No coercion or exploitation. Both buyer and seller have the option to cancel (khiyar) in certain circumstances. Business should be conducted with honesty — "The honest merchant will be with the prophets and martyrs on the Day of Judgment."',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['halal','business','transaction','trade','ethics']},
{id:'tr021',cat:'trade',sub:'Halal Business',marja:'khamenei',q:'What makes a business transaction halal?',a:'Halal business fundamentals: transparency in all dealings, honest representation of goods, fair pricing (no price gouging in necessities), prompt payment of debts, fulfillment of contracts, and avoidance of monopolistic practices. Islam encourages fair competition and discourages hoarding (ihtikar) of essential goods to drive up prices. Ethics are not separate from business in Islam — they are integral to every transaction.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['halal','business','transaction','trade','ethics']},
{id:'tr022',cat:'trade',sub:'Employment',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to work for non-Muslim companies?',a:'Working for non-Muslim companies is permissible as long as: (1) The work itself is halal (not producing alcohol, weapons of mass destruction, etc.), (2) The worker\'s specific role does not directly involve haram activities, (3) The work environment allows fulfilling religious obligations (prayer, fasting). Working in a mixed environment, earning a salary from a non-Muslim employer, and contributing to legitimate enterprises are all halal. Muslims should be exemplary workers — representing Islamic ethics through their professionalism.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['employment','non-Muslim','company','permissible','work']},
{id:'tr023',cat:'trade',sub:'Employment',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to work for non-Muslim companies?',a:'Employment with non-Muslim companies is permissible when the work is halal. Many scholars and professionals throughout Islamic history worked under non-Muslim rulers and companies while maintaining their faith. The key criteria: is the specific work halal? Can you pray on time? Are you forced to do anything against your religion? If the answer is satisfactory, the employment is fine. Muslims should strive for excellence in their work as a form of worship.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['employment','non-Muslim','company','permissible','work']},
{id:'tr024',cat:'trade',sub:'Employment',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to work for non-Muslim companies?',a:'There is no prohibition on working for non-Muslim employers. The vast majority of permissible jobs (engineering, medicine, teaching, technology, services, etc.) are equally halal whether the employer is Muslim or not. The work itself is what matters, not the employer\'s religion. Muslims in the workforce should: maintain their religious practices, demonstrate Islamic ethics, and contribute positively to their organizations and society.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['employment','non-Muslim','company','permissible','work']},
