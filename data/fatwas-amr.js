{id:'am001',cat:'amr',sub:'Obligation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is enjoining good and forbidding evil (amr bil ma\'ruf) obligatory?',a:'Amr bil ma\'ruf wa nahy anil munkar is wajib kifa\'i (communal obligation) and becomes wajib ayni (individual obligation) when: (1) The person knows what is ma\'ruf and munkar, (2) There is a possibility the other person will listen, (3) The other person intends to persist in their behavior, (4) There is no significant harm to the advisor. It has three stages: by heart (feeling displeasure), by tongue (verbal advice), and by hand (physical intervention — with strict conditions).',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['amr','maruf','munkar','obligatory','enjoining']},
{id:'am002',cat:'amr',sub:'Obligation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is enjoining good and forbidding evil (amr bil ma\'ruf) obligatory?',a:'This is one of the most important Islamic obligations and a pillar of social health. Its abandonment leads to societal corruption as warned by the Imams (as). The duty applies at all levels: individual, communal, and governmental. The Islamic government has the primary responsibility for institutionalized amr bil ma\'ruf. Individuals must practice it within proper boundaries and with wisdom.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['amr','maruf','munkar','obligatory','enjoining']},
{id:'am003',cat:'amr',sub:'Obligation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is enjoining good and forbidding evil (amr bil ma\'ruf) obligatory?',a:'The Quran calls Muslims "the best community raised for humanity" specifically because they "enjoin good and forbid evil" (3:110). Conditions include: knowledge of the matter, likelihood of positive effect, and absence of greater harm. The approach should be wise, gentle, and respectful — the Quran instructs: "Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching" (16:125).',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['amr','maruf','munkar','obligatory','enjoining']},
{id:'am004',cat:'amr',sub:'Method',marja:'sistani',q:'How should one practice amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'The stages are graduated: (1) Internal disapproval (showing displeasure without words), (2) Verbal counsel — done privately first, with kindness, wisdom, and respect for the person\'s dignity. Public rebuke is only for public sins. (3) Physical intervention — this is extremely limited and requires conditions that are rarely met in normal circumstances. At all stages, the advisor must not cause greater harm than the wrong being addressed. One should be a role model first.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['method','stages','wisdom','gentleness','counsel']},
{id:'am005',cat:'amr',sub:'Method',marja:'noori',q:'How should one practice amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'The methodology emphasizes the Prophet\'s example: begin with genuine kindness and concern for the person. Never advise from a position of self-righteousness. Imam Sadiq (as) said: "Be callers to goodness through means other than your tongues" — meaning through your actions first. Personal example is the most powerful form of amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['method','stages','wisdom','gentleness','counsel']},
{id:'am006',cat:'amr',sub:'Method',marja:'shirazi',q:'How should one practice amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Amr bil ma\'ruf requires: beautiful speech, appropriate timing, private setting (preferably), genuine care for the person, and avoiding embarrassment. The goal is not to assert authority but to genuinely help. If harsh words would push the person further away, silence is better. The Imams (as) won hearts through compassion and lived example.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['method','stages','wisdom','gentleness','counsel']},
{id:'am007',cat:'amr',sub:'Limits',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the limits of amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Important limits: (1) Do not spy on others to find sins — it applies to what is publicly visible, (2) Do not cause harm disproportionate to the wrong, (3) Do not transgress others\' rights in the process, (4) Physical intervention is practically restricted to governmental authority, (5) Personal advice should not become harassment — if the person clearly refuses, continuing forcefully is not obligatory, (6) One should not advise on matters where they themselves are deficient.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['limits','boundaries','privacy','proportionality']},
{id:'am008',cat:'amr',sub:'Limits',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the limits of amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Boundaries include: no violation of privacy, no vigilante justice, proportionality, respect for human dignity. The obligation does not authorize individuals to take the law into their own hands. In matters requiring enforcement, this is the government\'s responsibility. Individual obligation is primarily at the verbal and behavioral level.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['limits','boundaries','privacy','proportionality']},

{id:'am009',cat:'amr',sub:'Government Role',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the government\'s role in enjoining good?',a:'The Islamic government has the primary institutional responsibility for amr bil ma\'ruf at the societal level. This includes: establishing just laws, providing education, combating corruption, ensuring public morality, and creating social welfare systems. Individual obligation remains but the government\'s role is more comprehensive. The government should use wisdom, education, and gradual reform rather than heavy-handed enforcement.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['government','institutional','policy','responsibility','amr']},
{id:'am010',cat:'amr',sub:'Government Role',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the government\'s role in enjoining good?',a:'The Islamic government is the primary vehicle for organized amr bil ma\'ruf. The Wali al-Faqih and the governmental apparatus have the duty to establish goodness and prevent evil at the systemic level — through legislation, education, media policy, economic justice, and social programs. Individual duty complements but does not replace governmental responsibility. The government should model Islamic values.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['government','institutional','policy','responsibility','amr']},
{id:'am011',cat:'amr',sub:'Government Role',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the government\'s role in enjoining good?',a:'Government responsibility includes: creating ethical legal frameworks, providing quality Islamic education, supporting family structures, combating economic corruption, ensuring justice in courts, and promoting moral values through positive media. The approach should be nurturing and educational rather than purely punitive. A just government is itself the greatest form of amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['government','institutional','policy','responsibility','amr']},
{id:'am012',cat:'amr',sub:'Social Media',marja:'sistani',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply to social media?',a:'Yes, the obligation extends to all spheres of interaction including social media. If one sees harmful content (misinformation about Islam, morally destructive content, bullying), responding appropriately is part of amr bil ma\'ruf. However, the same conditions apply: knowledge, likelihood of positive effect, and not causing greater harm. Online debates that devolve into insults do not constitute proper amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['social media','online','digital','amr','internet']},
{id:'am013',cat:'amr',sub:'Social Media',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply to social media?',a:'Social media is a major arena for amr bil ma\'ruf in the modern age. Muslims should use platforms to spread authentic Islamic knowledge, counter misconceptions, and promote moral values. However, trolling, aggressive arguments, and public shaming are not proper methods. The digital space requires even more wisdom because content reaches massive audiences and mishandled attempts can damage Islam\'s image.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','online','digital','amr','internet']},
{id:'am014',cat:'amr',sub:'Social Media',marja:'makarem',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply to social media?',a:'The digital world is an extension of the physical world in Islamic rulings. Spreading Islamic knowledge online, correcting misconceptions with kindness, and modeling good character in digital spaces are all forms of amr bil ma\'ruf. Creating beneficial content, sharing scholarly resources, and building positive Islamic communities online are highly meritorious. Cyberbullying in the name of religion is absolutely contrary to Islamic ethics.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','online','digital','amr','internet']},
{id:'am015',cat:'amr',sub:'Family',marja:'sistani',q:'How should amr bil ma\'ruf be practiced within families?',a:'Within families, amr bil ma\'ruf takes the form of: parental guidance, spousal counsel, and mutual family support. Parents have a specific obligation to teach children Islamic values and correct wrong behavior with wisdom appropriate to the child\'s age. Between spouses, advice should be private, respectful, and compassionate. A husband cannot use amr bil ma\'ruf as justification for controlling or harsh behavior toward his wife.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['family','parenting','children','spouse','guidance']},
{id:'am016',cat:'amr',sub:'Family',marja:'noori',q:'How should amr bil ma\'ruf be practiced within families?',a:'Family is the primary unit for practicing amr bil ma\'ruf. The Prophet (s) and Imams (as) demonstrated that family guidance should be through: personal example (the most powerful teacher), loving conversation, patience with gradual improvement, and creating an environment conducive to faith. Harsh criticism, shaming, and comparing family members to others are counter-productive and un-Islamic methods.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['family','parenting','children','spouse','guidance']},
{id:'am017',cat:'amr',sub:'Family',marja:'makarem',q:'How should amr bil ma\'ruf be practiced within families?',a:'The Quran says: "Save yourselves and your families from fire" (66:6). This is the foundation of family amr bil ma\'ruf. Parents should: lead by example, create a loving Islamic atmosphere, engage children in discussions rather than lecturing, celebrate their achievements in faith, and be patient with their journey. Forced religiosity often produces the opposite effect and is not true amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['family','parenting','children','spouse','guidance']},
{id:'am018',cat:'amr',sub:'Social Media',marja:'sistani',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply to online spaces and social media?',a:'Yes, the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil extends to all spaces of human interaction, including social media. If one sees harmful content or sinful behavior online and believes their intervention could be effective, the obligation applies. However, online etiquette matters — public shaming, harassment, and mob behavior are not acceptable forms of amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['social media','online','amr','digital','internet']},
{id:'am019',cat:'amr',sub:'Social Media',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply to online spaces and social media?',a:'Digital spaces are part of the public sphere where amr bil ma\'ruf is obligatory. Muslims should promote good content and counter misinformation and corruption online. However, this must be done with wisdom — internet arguments rarely change minds. Creating positive content and modeling good behavior online is the most effective form of digital amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','online','amr','digital','internet']},
{id:'am020',cat:'amr',sub:'Social Media',marja:'makarem',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply to online spaces and social media?',a:'Social media has made amr bil ma\'ruf both easier and more complex. The opportunity to reach thousands is balanced by the risk of misunderstanding. Online enjoining should follow the same principles: wisdom, gentleness, knowledge, and avoiding harm. Anonymous attacks disguised as \'enjoining good\' are not islamically valid.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','online','amr','digital','internet']},
{id:'am021',cat:'amr',sub:'Government',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the government\'s role in amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'The Islamic government has the primary institutional responsibility for amr bil ma\'ruf through education, legislation, and social policy. This includes: promoting Islamic values in education, establishing just laws, combating corruption, protecting the vulnerable, and creating an environment where virtue thrives. However, government enforcement must respect individual dignity and not become oppressive.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['government','institutional','policy','enforcement','justice']},
{id:'am022',cat:'amr',sub:'Government',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the government\'s role in amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Within the Wilayat al-Faqih framework, the Islamic government is the most important institution for amr bil ma\'ruf. This includes: educational policy, media regulation, judicial enforcement, and social programs. The government should create conditions that make good easy and evil difficult. However, excessive policing of personal behavior can be counterproductive.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['government','institutional','policy','enforcement','justice']},
{id:'am023',cat:'amr',sub:'Government',marja:'noori',q:'What is the government\'s role in amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Government should focus on structural amr bil ma\'ruf — creating just economic systems, accessible education, healthcare, and social safety nets. When basic needs are met and justice prevails, virtue naturally increases. Imam Ali (as) in Nahj al-Balagha extensively discusses the ruler\'s role in creating a virtuous society through justice, not coercion.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['government','institutional','policy','enforcement','justice']},
{id:'am024',cat:'amr',sub:'Family',marja:'sistani',q:'How should amr bil ma\'ruf be practiced within the family?',a:'Within the family, amr bil ma\'ruf takes the form of proper tarbiyah (upbringing). Parents are obligated to teach children Islamic values, model good behavior, and gently correct mistakes. Between spouses, mutual counsel should be kind and private. The Prophet (s) never publicly embarrassed his family members. Key principles: lead by example, use positive reinforcement, maintain dignity, and be patient.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['family','tarbiyah','children','parenting','spouse']},
{id:'am025',cat:'amr',sub:'Family',marja:'makarem',q:'How should amr bil ma\'ruf be practiced within the family?',a:'Family is the primary school of amr bil ma\'ruf. Parents should: create a loving Islamic environment, explain the reasoning behind rules, be consistent, avoid harshness that breeds resentment, and recognize that children learn more from what parents DO than what they SAY. Between spouses, the Quran says they are "garments for each other" — counsel should be intimate and protective.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['family','tarbiyah','children','parenting','spouse']},
{id:'am026',cat:'amr',sub:'Family',marja:'shirazi',q:'How should amr bil ma\'ruf be practiced within the family?',a:'The home should be a sanctuary of faith. Imam Sajjad (as) in the Risalat al-Huquq outlines the rights of children to proper guidance. Family amr bil ma\'ruf means: regular Quran reading together, discussing Islamic concepts, answering questions honestly, and creating an atmosphere where faith feels natural and beautiful rather than restrictive.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['family','tarbiyah','children','parenting','spouse']},
{id:'am027',cat:'amr',sub:'Non-Muslims',marja:'sistani',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply when dealing with non-Muslims?',a:'Amr bil ma\'ruf toward non-Muslims takes the form of da\'wah (invitation) done with wisdom and beautiful preaching as commanded in the Quran (16:125). There is no compulsion in religion. Muslims should demonstrate Islamic values through their behavior. Imposing Islamic rules on non-Muslims who are not subject to them is not part of amr bil ma\'ruf.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['non-muslims','dawah','invitation','character','coexistence']},
{id:'am028',cat:'amr',sub:'Non-Muslims',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply when dealing with non-Muslims?',a:'In multicultural societies, amr bil ma\'ruf toward non-Muslims means: being the best example of Islamic character, engaging in respectful dialogue, standing for justice regardless of religion, and inviting without coercion. The Quran says: "You have your religion and I have mine" — mutual respect is fundamental.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['non-muslims','dawah','invitation','character','coexistence']},
{id:'am029',cat:'amr',sub:'Non-Muslims',marja:'makarem',q:'Does amr bil ma\'ruf apply when dealing with non-Muslims?',a:'The best amr bil ma\'ruf toward non-Muslims is akhlaq — excellent character. The Prophet (s) won more hearts through his character than through preaching. Muslims living in non-Muslim societies should be exemplary neighbors, colleagues, and citizens. This IS amr bil ma\'ruf — showing the beauty of Islam through lived practice.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['non-muslims','dawah','invitation','character','coexistence']},
{id:'am030',cat:'amr',sub:'Scholars\' Responsibility',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the special responsibility of scholars in amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Scholars bear a greater responsibility because they have knowledge. Their amr bil ma\'ruf includes: teaching, writing, issuing rulings, guiding the community, speaking truth to power, and defending the oppressed. Silence of scholars in the face of injustice is condemned in numerous hadith. Imam Hussain\'s (as) revolution was the ultimate amr bil ma\'ruf against tyranny.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['scholars','responsibility','duty','ulama','truth']},
{id:'am031',cat:'amr',sub:'Scholars\' Responsibility',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the special responsibility of scholars in amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'Scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets and bear proportional responsibility. They must: speak against injustice publicly, guide governments, educate the masses, protect the religion from distortion, and sacrifice personal comfort for truth. History judges scholars by whether they stood for truth or remained silent during crises.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['scholars','responsibility','duty','ulama','truth']},
{id:'am032',cat:'amr',sub:'Scholars\' Responsibility',marja:'hakim',q:'What is the special responsibility of scholars in amr bil ma\'ruf?',a:'The scholarly tradition in Najaf has always emphasized the scholar\'s duty to the community. This includes issuing timely guidance on contemporary issues, mediating conflicts, advocating for the marginalized, and maintaining independence from political pressure. A scholar who compromises truth for comfort has failed their fundamental duty.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['scholars','responsibility','duty','ulama','truth']},
{id:'am033',cat:'amr',sub:'Patience',marja:'sistani',q:'What if amr bil ma\'ruf leads to hostility or rejection?',a:'The Quran connects amr bil ma\'ruf with patience (sabr): "Enjoin good, forbid evil, and be patient over what befalls you" (31:17). If genuine effort is met with rejection, one has fulfilled their obligation. Persistence is commendable but should not become harassment. Sometimes stepping back and praying for the person is the wisest course. The results are with Allah.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['patience','rejection','sabr','persistence','hostility']},
{id:'am034',cat:'amr',sub:'Patience',marja:'makarem',q:'What if amr bil ma\'ruf leads to hostility or rejection?',a:'Rejection is natural and even expected. The Prophet (s) himself was rejected by many. The advisor should: not take it personally, continue their own good behavior, keep the door open for future communication, and never give up hope for the person. Imam Ali (as) said: "Do good and don\'t worry about whom you\'re doing it for — it will not be wasted."',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['patience','rejection','sabr','persistence','hostility']},
{id:'am035',cat:'amr',sub:'Patience',marja:'noori',q:'What if amr bil ma\'ruf leads to hostility or rejection?',a:'Patience after amr bil ma\'ruf is itself an act of worship. The advisor should examine: was my approach correct? Was my timing appropriate? Was my intention pure? If all were good and rejection still came, accept it with grace. The Prophet Nuh (as) preached for 950 years — persistence with patience is the prophetic model.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['patience','rejection','sabr','persistence','hostility']},
