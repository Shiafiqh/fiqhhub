It is mustahab to move the person to their usual place of prayer if possible.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['dying','qiblah','talqin','obligations']},
{id:'dt002',cat:'death',sub:'Dying Person',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the obligations toward a dying Muslim?',a:'The obligation to face the dying toward Qiblah applies to all Muslims present.

One should encourage the dying person to recite the shahada if they are able, and recite it on their behalf if they cannot.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['dying','qiblah','talqin','obligations']},
{id:'dt003',cat:'death',sub:'Dying Person',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the obligations toward a dying Muslim?',a:'Facing the dying person toward Qiblah is wajib on the basis of obligatory precaution.

If sidr or camphor is unavailable, perform all three with pure water.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ghusl','mayyit','washing','deceased','sidr','camphor']},
{id:'dt005',cat:'death',sub:'Ghusl al-Mayyit',marja:'khamenei',q:'How is the ghusl (washing) of a deceased person performed?',a:'Three sequential ghusls are obligatory. The amounts of sidr and camphor should be enough to be noticeable but not so much that the water becomes mudhaf (mixed).

Cotton should be placed to prevent leakage from body openings. The person performing the ghusl should have wudu preferably, though it is not a condition of validity.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ghusl','mayyit','washing','deceased','sidr','camphor']},
{id:'dt007',cat:'death',sub:'Ghusl al-Mayyit',marja:'sistani',q:'What if the deceased cannot be given ghusl?',a:'If ghusl is not possible (no water available, body is burned, or would disintegrate upon contact with water), then tayammum should be performed instead — three tayammums corresponding to the three ghusls. If even tayammum is impossible, the body is buried without ghusl. In cases of epidemic where touching the body is dangerous, the authorities should be consulted.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ghusl','tayammum','deceased','impossibility']},
{id:'dt008',cat:'death',sub:'Ghusl al-Mayyit',marja:'makarem',q:'What if the deceased cannot be given ghusl?',a:'Tayammum replaces ghusl when water is unavailable or the body cannot tolerate washing.

{id:'dt011',cat:'death',sub:'Kafan',marja:'bashir',q:'What are the requirements for shrouding (kafan) the deceased?',a:'The kafan requirements are the same three pieces.

It should be performed before burial; if forgotten, it is performed at the grave.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['salat','mayyit','funeral','prayer','takbir']},
{id:'dt014',cat:'death',sub:'Salat al-Mayyit',marja:'makarem',q:'How is the funeral prayer (Salat al-Mayyit) performed?',a:'Five takbirs without ruku or sujud.

{id:'dt015',cat:'death',sub:'Burial',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for Islamic burial?',a:'The body must be buried in the ground deep enough that animals cannot reach it and the smell does not emerge.

Talqin should be recited after burial.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['burial','grave','qiblah','cremation','talqin']},
{id:'dt016',cat:'death',sub:'Burial',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules for Islamic burial?',a:'Burial must be in the earth; cremation is haram. The body faces Qiblah on the right side.

Exhumation after burial is generally haram except for specific valid reasons.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['burial','grave','qiblah','cremation','talqin']},
{id:'dt017',cat:'death',sub:'Burial',marja:'shirazi',q:'What are the rules for Islamic burial?',a:'The grave should be deep enough for protection and odor prevention.

{id:'dt020',cat:'death',sub:'Burial',marja:'bashir',q:'Is it permissible to transport the deceased to another city for burial?',a:'Transportation to sacred sites is recommended.

{id:'dt021',cat:'death',sub:'Mourning',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines on mourning?',a:'Mourning for the deceased is natural and permissible. Crying is allowed and even praised in hadith. The mourning period has no fixed limit in Shia fiqh, though excessive mourning that leads to questioning Allah\'s decree is discouraged. Wearing black is a cultural practice, not a religious obligation. Holding majalis (gatherings) for the deceased on the 3rd, 7th, and 40th days is customary and recommended. Wailing with exaggerated expressions is makruh.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mourning','grief','majlis','iddah','fatiha']},
{id:'dt022',cat:'death',sub:'Mourning',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines on mourning?',a:'Mourning is permissible and natural.

{id:'dt023',cat:'death',sub:'Mourning',marja:'noori',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines on mourning?',a:'Mourning should be balanced — expressing grief is human and Islamic, but it should be coupled with patience (sabr) and trust in Allah\'s wisdom.

{id:'dt024',cat:'death',sub:'Inheritance',marja:'sistani',q:'Who is responsible for funeral expenses?',a:'Funeral expenses (ghusl, kafan, burial, and transportation if customary) are taken from the deceased\'s estate BEFORE distributing inheritance and paying debts. These expenses should be reasonable and not extravagant. If the deceased has no estate, the expenses fall on those who were obligated to maintain them (like the husband for his wife). If there is no one, it becomes a community obligation.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['expenses','funeral','estate','inheritance','responsibility']},
{id:'dt025',cat:'death',sub:'Inheritance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who is responsible for funeral expenses?',a:'Funeral costs are the first charge on the estate, preceding debts and bequests.

{id:'dt026',cat:'death',sub:'Inheritance',marja:'makarem',q:'Who is responsible for funeral expenses?',a:'The essential funeral costs come from the estate before any distribution.

{id:'dt027',cat:'death',sub:'Visiting Graves',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on visiting graves?',a:'Visiting graves is mustahab (recommended) and has great spiritual benefit. It reminds one of the hereafter and encourages good deeds. Reciting Surah al-Fatiha, Surah Ya-Sin, and other Quranic chapters for the deceased is rewarded. Visiting on Thursdays and Fridays is especially recommended. Women may also visit graves; the hadith discouraging women applies to the pre-Islamic practice of excessive wailing.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ziyarat','graves','visiting','mustahab','quran']},
{id:'dt028',cat:'death',sub:'Visiting Graves',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on visiting graves?',a:'Ziyarat of graves is recommended.

{id:'dt029',cat:'death',sub:'Visiting Graves',marja:'shirazi',q:'What is the ruling on visiting graves?',a:'Visiting graves is strongly recommended.

{id:'dt030',cat:'death',sub:'Life After Death',marja:'sistani',q:'What happens to the soul after death in Shia belief?',a:'After death, the soul (ruh) enters Barzakh — the intermediate realm between death and resurrection. In Barzakh: (1) The believing soul experiences peace and divine mercy, (2) The sinful soul may experience punishment, (3) The soul is conscious and aware, (4) Good deeds from the living (prayers, charity, Quran recitation) benefit the deceased. The body decomposes but the soul continues its journey. Two angels (Nakir and Munkar) question the deceased about their beliefs. The quality of Barzakh experience depends on one\'s faith and deeds.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['death','soul','barzakh','afterlife','belief']},
{id:'dt031',cat:'death',sub:'Life After Death',marja:'khamenei',q:'What happens to the soul after death in Shia belief?',a:'Barzakh is the intermediate world between death and the Day of Judgment. The soul continues to exist in a state that reflects their earthly deeds. The righteous experience comfort and glad tidings of paradise, while the sinful may experience difficulty. Importantly, the living can help the deceased through: dua, charity in their name, performing missed prayers and fasts, Quran recitation, and visiting graves. The soul maintains awareness and connection.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['death','soul','barzakh','afterlife','belief']},
