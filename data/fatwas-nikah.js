{id:'n001',cat:'nikah',sub:'Contract',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for a valid Islamic marriage contract?',a:'A valid nikah (marriage contract) requires: (1) Offer (ijab) — stated by the bride or her representative: "Zawwajtuka nafsi" (I marry myself to you). (2) Acceptance (qabul) — stated by the groom: "Qabiltu" (I accept). (3) Both parties must specify the mahr (dowry). (4) The formula should ideally be in Arabic, though some scholars allow other languages if Arabic is not understood. (5) Both parties must be sane and of legal age. (6) The marriage must be free of impediments (mahram relationships, iddah period, etc.). (7) Consent of both parties is essential. Witnesses are recommended but not a condition for validity in Shia fiqh.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2, Nikah',tags:['nikah','contract','conditions','marriage','validity']},
{id:'n002',cat:'nikah',sub:'Consent',marja:'sistani',q:'Is the father\'s permission required for a virgin girl\'s marriage?',a:'According to the obligatory precaution, the permission of the father (or paternal grandfather) is required for the marriage of a virgin girl, even if she is an adult. However, if the father unreasonably withholds permission — for example, refusing all suitable proposals without valid shariah reason — his permission is no longer required. If the father is absent, uncontactable, or has abandoned the family, his permission is likewise not required. For a previously married woman (non-virgin), the father\'s permission is not needed. This ruling aims to protect the girl\'s interests while ensuring parental involvement.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 2377',tags:['nikah','consent','father','virgin','permission']},
{id:'n003',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mahr',marja:'khamenei',q:'What can be specified as mahr (dowry)?',a:'The mahr can be anything of value that the couple agrees upon: money, gold, property, goods, or even a service (like teaching Quran). There is no minimum or maximum, though moderation is recommended following the Prophetic tradition — the best marriage is one with the lightest mahr. The mahr is the wife\'s exclusive right. It can be paid immediately (mu\'ajjal) or deferred (mu\'ajjal). If no mahr is specified in the contract, the marriage is still valid, and the wife is entitled to mahr al-mithl (the customary mahr for a woman of her status). The husband is obligated to pay the mahr on demand.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['mahr','dowry','amount','rights','wife']},
{id:'n004',cat:'nikah',sub:'Temporary Marriage',marja:'sistani',q:'What is mut\'ah (temporary marriage) and what are its conditions?',a:'Mut\'ah (temporary marriage) is a legitimate marriage in Shia Islam with a specified duration. Its conditions include: (1) A specific time period must be set (hours, days, months, years). (2) A mahr must be specified. (3) The formula is: she says "Zawwajtuka nafsi fil-muddatil-ma\'lumah alal-mahril-ma\'lum" and he says "Qabiltu." (4) There must be no impediments (mahram, iddah, etc.). (5) A Muslim woman cannot contract mut\'ah with a non-Muslim man. (6) As an obligatory precaution, a Muslim man should not contract mut\'ah with a non-Kitabi non-Muslim woman. After the period expires, the marriage ends automatically. The woman must observe iddah of two menstrual cycles (or 45 days).',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2',tags:['mutah','temporary','marriage','conditions','time']},
{id:'n005',cat:'nikah',sub:'Prohibited Marriages',marja:'makarem',q:'Who is permanently prohibited (mahram) for marriage?',a:'Permanently prohibited marriage partners include: (1) Blood relations: mother, daughter, sister, paternal aunt, maternal aunt, brother\'s daughter, sister\'s daughter (and their male equivalents). (2) Relations through marriage: mother-in-law (permanently after marriage), daughter-in-law (son\'s wife), stepdaughter (if marriage to her mother was consummated), stepmother (father\'s wife). (3) Relations through breastfeeding: a woman who breastfed you and her relations become mahram under specific conditions (the child must have been breastfed 15 consecutive times or for a full day and night from one woman, within the first two years of birth). These prohibitions are permanent and can never be married.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Nikah prohibitions',tags:['mahram','prohibited','marriage','blood','breastfeeding']},
{id:'n006',cat:'nikah',sub:'Interfaith Marriage',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a Muslim man marry a Christian or Jewish woman?',a:'A Muslim man may marry a Christian or Jewish (Ahlul Kitab) woman in a permanent marriage, though it is makruh (discouraged). For temporary marriage (mut\'ah) with an Ahlul Kitab woman, it is permissible according to many scholars. However, a Muslim woman is absolutely prohibited from marrying any non-Muslim man, whether Ahlul Kitab or otherwise — this prohibition is by consensus (ijma\'). If a non-Muslim husband converts to Islam but his wife is Ahlul Kitab, the marriage continues. If neither spouse is Muslim and the wife later converts but the husband does not, specific waiting period rules apply to determine if the marriage continues.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2',tags:['interfaith','marriage','christian','jewish','ahlul kitab']},
{id:'n007',cat:'nikah',sub:'Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the wife\'s financial rights in marriage?',a:'The wife has several financial rights: (1) Mahr — the agreed dowry, payable on demand. (2) Nafaqah — the husband is obligated to provide maintenance including housing appropriate to her status, food, clothing, medical expenses, and household items. This obligation exists regardless of the wife\'s own wealth. (3) She retains full ownership of her own property, earnings, and inheritance — the husband has no right over her personal wealth. (4) She may work and keep her earnings. (5) If the husband fails to provide nafaqah, she can seek it through the Islamic court and may be permitted to take from his wealth what is customary. These rights apply in permanent marriage; temporary marriage has different nafaqah rules.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['wife','rights','financial','nafaqah','mahr']},
{id:'n008',cat:'nikah',sub:'Contract',marja:'shirazi',q:'Can conditions be added to the marriage contract?',a:'Yes, both parties can stipulate conditions in the marriage contract, provided the conditions do not contradict the essence of marriage or Islamic law. Valid conditions include: (1) The wife stipulating the right to divorce under certain circumstances. (2) The wife stipulating the right to continue education or work. (3) Specifying the place of residence. (4) Stipulating that the husband will not marry a second wife. (5) Financial arrangements. If a valid condition is violated, the other party has the right to annul the marriage. Conditions that are against shariah (e.g., no inheritance rights) are void but do not invalidate the marriage itself.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Marriage conditions',tags:['nikah','conditions','stipulations','contract','rights']},
{id:'n009',cat:'nikah',sub:'Second Marriage',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for marrying a second wife?',a:'Islam permits a man to have up to four permanent wives simultaneously, but with strict conditions: (1) He must be able to treat all wives with justice and equality in terms of financial provision, time, and treatment. (2) He must be financially capable of providing for multiple households. (3) If he stipulated in the first marriage contract not to marry again, he is bound by that condition. (4) While the first wife\'s permission is not technically a shariah requirement, treating her justly includes considering her feelings and wellbeing. Marrying a second wife while unable to maintain justice is sinful. The Quranic verse "if you fear you cannot be just, then only one" (4:3) emphasizes the difficulty of this justice.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['polygamy','second wife','conditions','justice']},
{id:'n010',cat:'nikah',sub:'Contract',marja:'hakim',q:'Is it valid to conduct a marriage contract online or by phone?',a:'A marriage contract conducted by phone, video call, or online platforms can be valid if the essential elements are present: both parties clearly hear each other, the offer and acceptance are expressed in proper form, and the mahr is specified. The key is that both parties (or their representatives) clearly communicate and understand the terms. Written agreements alone (text messages, emails) are not sufficient — the verbal formula of ijab and qabul must be pronounced. Having a scholar or knowledgeable person facilitate the contract and witnesses present (even via video) is strongly recommended to avoid disputes.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['nikah','online','phone','distance','validity']},
{id:'n011',cat:'nikah',sub:'Temporary Marriage',marja:'makarem',q:'Does the woman need her father\'s permission for mut\'ah?',a:'The same ruling that applies to permanent marriage applies to temporary marriage regarding the father\'s permission. For a virgin girl (who has never been married before), the permission of her father or paternal grandfather is required as an obligatory precaution, even for mut\'ah. If the father\'s permission cannot be obtained (he is absent, refusing without reason, or deceased), the same exemptions apply. For a previously married woman, whether divorced or widowed, the father\'s permission is not required for mut\'ah. Some scholars are more lenient regarding mut\'ah specifically, but the cautious position requires permission for virgins.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mutah','permission','father','virgin','temporary']},
{id:'n012',cat:'nikah',sub:'Rights',marja:'wahid',q:'What are the husband\'s rights in marriage?',a:'The husband\'s primary rights include: (1) Tamkin — the wife should be available for marital intimacy when the husband reasonably desires, unless she has a legitimate excuse (illness, menstruation, obligatory fasting, etc.). (2) The wife should not leave the marital home without the husband\'s permission for non-essential outings, though this does not apply to emergency situations, obligatory acts (like Hajj), visiting parents within reason, or fulfilling her own rights. (3) Not admitting anyone into the home whom the husband objects to. These rights are reciprocal — the husband also has obligations including kind treatment, financial provision, and respecting the wife\'s dignity and independence.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['husband','rights','tamkin','obligations']},
{id:'n013',cat:'nikah',sub:'Engagement',marja:'najafi',q:'What is the ruling on engagement before marriage?',a:'Engagement (khutbah) is a promise to marry and is separate from the actual marriage contract. During engagement: (1) The couple are not yet married — rules of non-mahram still apply. (2) Looking at the prospective spouse\'s face and hands is permitted for the purpose of deciding on marriage. (3) Being alone together (khalwah) is not permissible. (4) The engagement can be broken by either party without sin, though it is discourteous to break it without valid reason. (5) Gifts given during engagement are generally considered gifts and need not be returned if the engagement is broken, unless there was an explicit condition. (6) It is recommended to pray istikhara and consult family.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['engagement','khutbah','looking','halal','rules']},
{id:'n014',cat:'nikah',sub:'Contract',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the iddah period after permanent marriage ends?',a:'The iddah (waiting period) varies: (1) Divorce: 3 menstrual cycles (or 3 months for those who don\'t menstruate). (2) Death of husband: 4 months and 10 days (even if the marriage was not consummated). (3) If pregnant: the iddah extends until delivery, in both divorce and death cases. (4) Temporary marriage (mut\'ah) ending: 2 menstrual cycles (or 45 days). (5) If mut\'ah was not consummated: no iddah. (6) Menopausal woman after divorce: 3 months. During iddah of death, the wife must avoid adornment and certain activities. During iddah of revocable divorce, the husband can return without a new contract.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Iddah',tags:['iddah','waiting period','divorce','death','duration']},
{id:'n015',cat:'nikah',sub:'Breastfeeding',marja:'makarem',q:'What conditions make breastfeeding create mahram relations?',a:'Breastfeeding (rada\'ah) establishes mahram relationships under these conditions: (1) The child must be breastfed at least 15 consecutive feedings without interruption by another food source, or for a full 24-hour period exclusively. (2) The milk must be from one woman who became pregnant from one man. (3) The breastfeeding must occur within the first two years of the child\'s life. (4) The child must drink directly from the breast (not expressed/bottled milk according to most scholars). (5) Each feeding must be full (the baby feeds until satisfied and detaches). When these conditions are met, the nursed child becomes mahram to the breastfeeding woman, her husband, and their relatives.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Rada\'ah',tags:['breastfeeding','mahram','conditions','radaah']},
{id:'nk016',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mahr',marja:'sistani',q:'What is mahr (dowry) and what are its rules?',a:'Mahr is the wife\'s absolute right — a gift from the husband specified in the marriage contract. Rules: (1) It can be anything of value — money, property, gold, even teaching Quran. (2) It becomes the wife\'s exclusive property — the husband has no right to it. (3) It can be paid immediately (mu\'ajjal) or deferred (mu\'ajjal). (4) The wife can demand immediate payment at any time. (5) She can withhold marital relations until the mahr is paid (if it was meant to be immediate). (6) If no mahr is specified, the marriage is valid and she receives mahr al-mithl (comparable mahr).',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mahr','dowry','marriage','wife','right','payment']},
{id:'nk017',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mahr',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is mahr (dowry) and what are its rules?',a:'Mahr is the wife\'s financial right from the marriage contract. The Sunnah encourages reasonable mahr — the Prophet (s) said: "The best women of my ummah are those with the lightest mahr." Excessive mahr can create financial burden and social pressure. The mahr can be in any permissible form: gold coins, money, property, or even non-material things like memorizing Quran. It is fully the wife\'s property and she can dispose of it as she wishes.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['mahr','dowry','marriage','wife','right','payment']},
{id:'nk018',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mahr',marja:'makarem',q:'What is mahr (dowry) and what are its rules?',a:'Mahr is both a legal right and a symbol of the husband\'s commitment. Modern considerations: (1) Extremely high mahr that the husband cannot realistically pay creates problems — the Sunnah encourages moderation. (2) The wife can forgive part or all of the mahr voluntarily — but no pressure should be applied. (3) In case of divorce, the wife keeps the full mahr if the marriage was consummated, and half if divorced before consummation. (4) Currency fluctuations may affect the value of mahr set in specific amounts — some scholars advise tying it to gold.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['mahr','dowry','marriage','wife','right','payment']},
{id:'nk019',cat:'nikah',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a woman set conditions in the marriage contract?',a:'Yes, a woman can stipulate conditions in the marriage contract (aqd), and if the husband agrees, these become binding. Valid conditions include: (1) Right to education/employment, (2) Right to choose residence location, (3) Right to travel, (4) Financial conditions, (5) Delegation of divorce right (tawkil), (6) Any condition that doesn\'t contradict the nature of marriage.

Conditions should be clearly stated and documented.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['conditions','marriage','contract','wife','rights','stipulation']},
{id:'nk020',cat:'nikah',sub:'Conditions',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can a woman set conditions in the marriage contract?',a:'Marriage conditions stipulated in the contract are legally binding. In the Islamic Republic, standard marriage contracts include several pre-printed conditions that can be checked, including: the wife\'s right to divorce if the husband takes a second wife without her consent, right to half the husband\'s wealth in case of divorce, and right to education and employment. Additional conditions can be added. These contractual rights protect women within the Islamic legal framework.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['conditions','marriage','contract','wife','rights','stipulation']},
{id:'nk021',cat:'nikah',sub:'Conditions',marja:'makarem',q:'Can a woman set conditions in the marriage contract?',a:'Setting conditions in the marriage contract is the woman\'s right and is encouraged for preventing future disputes. The conditions must be: (1) Agreed upon by both parties, (2) Documented in the contract, (3) Not contradicting Islamic law, (4) Not contradicting the fundamental rights and obligations of marriage. Example valid conditions: right to continue education, right to work in a specific field, residence in a particular city, financial transparency between spouses. Example invalid condition: no marital relations at all (contradicts marriage essence).',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['conditions','marriage','contract','wife','rights','stipulation']},
{id:'nk022',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mut\'a',marja:'sistani',q:'What is mut\'a (temporary marriage) and what are its conditions?',a:'Mut\'a (temporary marriage) is permissible in Shia Islam based on Quran (4:24) and hadith. Conditions: (1) Specific formula must be recited (sighah), (2) A specific time period must be agreed upon, (3) A specific mahr must be set, (4) The woman must not be currently married, (5) She must not be in iddah, (6) A Muslim woman can do mut\'a with a Muslim man; a Muslim man can do mut\'a with a Muslim or Ahl al-Kitab woman, (7) A virgin girl needs her father\'s permission on obligatory precaution. The temporary wife has right to mahr but not nafaqah (maintenance) unless stipulated.

{id:'nk023',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mut\'a',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is mut\'a (temporary marriage) and what are its conditions?',a:'Mut\'a is halal and has legal framework. It was practiced during the Prophet\'s time and only Umar banned it — Shia scholars consider that ban invalid as it contradicts the Quran. Conditions include mutual consent, specified duration, specified mahr, and adherence to all Islamic ethics. It is not a casual arrangement — it carries responsibilities. The woman observes iddah after the period ends (2 menstrual cycles or 45 days). Children have full legal rights.

{id:'nk024',cat:'nikah',sub:'Mut\'a',marja:'makarem',q:'What is mut\'a (temporary marriage) and what are its conditions?',a:'Mut\'a is permitted but should be understood properly: it is a legal framework with specific rules, not a loophole for casual relationships. Practical guidance: (1) The formula must be recited (the woman says "zawwajtuka nafsi..." with the period and mahr specified), (2) Both parties must be eligible, (3) The iddah must be observed, (4) Children are 100% legitimate, (5) It provides a halal option in situations where permanent marriage is not feasible.

The technical obligations exist as a framework, but the Prophetic model shows: the Prophet (s) helped with housework, mended his own clothes, and treated his wives as partners.

It is appropriate for situations where permanent marriage is not feasible: students, travelers, widows/divorcees. The woman\'s dignity and rights must be fully protected.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['mutah','temporary','marriage','permissible','quran']},
{id:'nk042',cat:'nikah',sub:'Wife\'s Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the wife\'s rights in marriage?',a:'The wife\'s rights include: (1) Mahr — her exclusive property, (2) Nafaqah — the husband must provide food, clothing, housing, and medical care appropriate to his means, (3) Kind treatment — "Live with them in kindness" (4:19), (4) Intimacy rights — the husband should not neglect his wife, (5) Freedom to manage her own wealth, (6) Right to work and earn with reasonable consideration of family duties, (7) Education rights, (8) Right to visit her family. Any form of physical or emotional abuse is absolutely haram.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['wife','rights','marriage','nafaqah','treatment']},
{id:'nk043',cat:'nikah',sub:'Wife\'s Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the wife\'s rights in marriage?',a:'Islam grants comprehensive rights to wives: financial maintenance without condition (even if she is wealthy), respectful treatment, emotional support, shared decision-making in family matters, freedom to maintain her personal wealth, right to education, right to work (with mutual agreement), and protection from harm. The Prophet (s) said: "The best of you is the best to his family, and I am the best to my family."

{id:'nk044',cat:'nikah',sub:'Husband Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the husband\'s rights in marriage?',a:'The husband\'s rights include: (1) Obedience in matters related to marital life — specifically, the wife should not leave the house without his permission for non-obligatory matters (this right is debated in scope by scholars), (2) Intimacy rights within reasonable bounds, (3) Respect and kind treatment, (4) Maintaining the household (though not an absolute obligation on the wife). These rights are balanced by his extensive obligations: nafaqah, mahr, kind treatment, justice, and emotional support.

{id:'nk045',cat:'nikah',sub:'Husband Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the husband\'s rights in marriage?',a:'The husband has certain rights related to family management and intimacy, balanced by his comprehensive obligations. The Quran describes spouses as "garments for each other" (2:187) — indicating mutual protection, comfort, and support. The husband\'s right to family management (qiwamah - 4:34) comes with the obligation to provide, protect, and decide with consultation (shura).

(2) Good character (akhlaq), (3) Compatibility in social standing (kafa\'ah), (4) Physical attraction and health, (5) Family background, (6) Education and intellectual compatibility.

Additional considerations: emotional maturity, shared values and life goals, communication compatibility, willingness to fulfill marital duties, mental health, and family support. Islamic istikharah (seeking divine guidance) is recommended after doing due diligence. Meeting the potential spouse (within Islamic guidelines) is encouraged to assess compatibility. Rushing into marriage without proper investigation is unwise.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['spouse','choosing','compatibility','character','religion','marriage']},
{id:'nk048',cat:'nikah',sub:'Compatibility',marja:'noori',q:'What factors should be considered when choosing a spouse?',a:'Choosing a spouse is one of life\'s most important decisions. The hadith literature provides comprehensive guidance: seek the person of deen and akhlaq first. Imam Sadiq (as) advised looking at the potential spouse\'s relationship with their parents as an indicator of character. Practical compatibility (financial expectations, lifestyle, where to live, family planning) should also be discussed openly before commitment.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['spouse','choosing','compatibility','character','religion','marriage']},
