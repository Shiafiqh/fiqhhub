{id:'tl001',cat:'talaq',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for a valid divorce?',a:'A valid divorce (talaq) requires: (1) The husband pronounces the formula "Anti taliq" (You are divorced) or its equivalent. (2) Two just (adil) male witnesses must be present. (3) The wife must not be in menstruation at the time (she must be in a period of purity in which intercourse did not occur). (4) The husband must be sane, baligh, acting by free will (not coerced), and serious (not joking). (5) The specific wife must be identified. (6) The pronouncement must be in Arabic if possible. Without any of these conditions, the divorce is invalid. This is a significant protection for women in Shia fiqh compared to some other schools.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2, Talaq',tags:['talaq','divorce','conditions','witnesses','validity']},
{id:'tl002',cat:'talaq',sub:'Types',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the difference between revocable and irrevocable divorce?',a:'Revocable divorce (talaq raj\'i) allows the husband to return to the wife during her iddah period without a new contract — simply by expressing his intention to return (ruju\'). This applies to the first and second divorces of a consummated marriage. Irrevocable divorce (talaq ba\'in) does not allow return during iddah. It applies to: (1) Divorce before consummation. (2) Divorce of a menopausal woman. (3) Khul\' divorce (where wife gives something to be released). (4) Mubarat divorce (mutual dislike). (5) The third divorce — after which they cannot remarry unless the wife marries another man first (muhallil), consummates that marriage, and is then divorced from him.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['talaq','revocable','irrevocable','types','ruju']},
{id:'tl003',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'sistani',q:'What is khul\' divorce and how does it work?',a:'Khul\' divorce occurs when the wife dislikes the husband and wishes to separate by returning part or all of her mahr or giving some compensation. The process: (1) The wife expresses her desire to separate and offers compensation (e.g., returning mahr). (2) The husband pronounces the divorce formula including the compensation. (3) Two just witnesses must be present. (4) Standard conditions of divorce apply (purity, etc.). The wife can retract during the iddah — if she reclaims the compensation during iddah, the divorce becomes revocable and the husband can return. This form of divorce empowers the wife to seek separation when the husband is unwilling.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2',tags:['khul','divorce','wife','compensation','mahr']},
{id:'tl004',cat:'talaq',sub:'Rights',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the wife\'s rights during the iddah of divorce?',a:'During the iddah of a revocable divorce, the wife retains significant rights: (1) She remains in the marital home — the husband cannot expel her, and she should not leave without necessity. (2) The husband must continue providing full nafaqah (maintenance, food, housing, clothing). (3) She is still considered his wife in many respects. (4) She has inheritance rights if either spouse dies during this period. (5) The husband may return to her without a new contract. In irrevocable divorce, the wife has the right to housing during iddah if she is pregnant (and nafaqah continues until delivery), but other marital rights cease.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['iddah','rights','nafaqah','divorce','housing']},
{id:'tl005',cat:'talaq',sub:'Annulment',marja:'shirazi',q:'Under what circumstances can a marriage be annulled (faskh)?',a:'Marriage can be annulled without divorce in specific cases: (1) Discovery of defects present before marriage that were concealed: for the man — castration, impotence; for the woman — certain conditions that prevent intercourse, severe mental illness, leprosy. (2) Violation of a condition stipulated in the marriage contract. (3) The husband\'s inability or refusal to pay mahr. (4) The husband\'s failure to provide nafaqah despite ability. (5) Deception (tadlis) — if one party was significantly misrepresented before marriage. Annulment does not count as one of the three divorces and does not require the divorce formula or witnesses.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['annulment','faskh','defects','deception','conditions']},
{id:'tl006',cat:'talaq',sub:'Conditions',marja:'wahid',q:'Is a divorce pronounced in anger valid?',a:'If the person was angry but still in control of their faculties — understanding what they were saying and intending it — the divorce is valid (provided other conditions like witnesses and the wife\'s state of purity are met). However, if the anger was so extreme that the person lost control of their mental faculties and did not truly intend the divorce, it is not valid. The standard is not the level of anger but whether the person was in a state where they understood and intended their words. Mere regret after pronouncing divorce does not invalidate it if the conditions were met.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['talaq','anger','validity','intention','mental state']},
{id:'tl007',cat:'talaq',sub:'Triple Divorce',marja:'sistani',q:'Is "triple talaq" (three divorces at once) valid?',a:'In Shia jurisprudence, pronouncing three divorces in one sitting counts as only ONE divorce, not three. This is a fundamental difference from some Sunni schools. The divorce formula must be pronounced separately on three separate occasions, each time with the wife in a state of purity after a period where no intercourse occurred, and with witnesses present each time. Between the first and second divorce, the husband must return (ruju\') during iddah or they must remarry, then divorce again following all conditions. Therefore, "I divorce you three times" said once = one divorce only.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['triple talaq','three divorces','one sitting','shia']},
{id:'tl008',cat:'talaq',sub:'Rights',marja:'hakim',q:'What happens to the mahr upon divorce?',a:'Upon divorce: (1) If the marriage was consummated, the wife is entitled to the full mahr. (2) If the marriage was not consummated, the wife is entitled to half the mahr. (3) If no mahr was specified and the marriage was consummated, she receives mahr al-mithl (customary mahr for women of her status). (4) If she was not consummated and no mahr specified, she receives mut\'ah (a gift/consolation based on the husband\'s financial status). (5) In khul\' divorce, the wife returns some or all mahr as part of the arrangement. (6) Deferred mahr becomes immediately due upon divorce. The mahr is the wife\'s absolute right and cannot be waived by anyone except her.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['mahr','divorce','consummation','rights','half']},
{id:'tl009',cat:'talaq',sub:'Conditions',marja:'najafi',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce proceedings in Shia Islam?',a:'While only the husband can pronounce the divorce formula, a woman has several paths to end a marriage: (1) Khul\' divorce — she can request divorce by offering compensation. (2) Contractual right — if the right to divorce was stipulated in the marriage contract. (3) Court-ordered divorce — a shariah judge can grant divorce if the husband is absent, refuses to divorce without justification, fails to provide nafaqah, or is causing significant harm. (4) Annulment (faskh) — for specific defects or deception. (5) She can appeal to a marja or Islamic authority who may compel the husband or grant divorce. The system provides multiple avenues for a woman to exit an untenable marriage.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['divorce','woman','initiate','khul','court']},
{id:'tl010',cat:'talaq',sub:'Types',marja:'hamedani',q:'What is mubarat divorce?',a:'Mubarat divorce occurs when both husband and wife mutually dislike each other and wish to separate. Unlike khul\' (where only the wife dislikes), in mubarat both parties want to end the marriage. The wife gives compensation to the husband, but it must not exceed the amount of her mahr — this is the key difference from khul\' where the compensation can theoretically exceed the mahr. The formula, conditions (witnesses, purity), and iddah are similar to khul\'. Mubarat divorce is irrevocable — the husband cannot return during iddah unless the wife reclaims her compensation, in which case it becomes revocable.',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah',tags:['mubarat','mutual','divorce','compensation','irrevocable']},
{id:'tl011',cat:'talaq',sub:'Iddah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the iddah (waiting period) after divorce?',a:'After divorce (talaq), the wife must observe iddah: (1) Regular divorce (of a woman who menstruates): 3 complete menstrual cycles (3 periods of purity between menstruations). (2) Post-menopausal woman or young girl: 3 months. (3) Pregnant woman: until delivery, even if delivery is the next day. (4) Temporary marriage (mut\'a): 2 menstrual cycles or 45 days. During iddah of revocable divorce, the husband can take her back without a new contract. The wife has right to housing and maintenance during iddah.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['iddah','divorce','waiting period','menstrual','pregnant','talaq']},
{id:'tl012',cat:'talaq',sub:'Iddah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the iddah (waiting period) after divorce?',a:'The iddah serves multiple purposes: confirming whether the wife is pregnant, giving time for potential reconciliation, and providing a transition period. During revocable divorce (first or second talaq), the wife stays in the marital home, the husband provides maintenance, and he can revoke the divorce simply by saying so or through any action indicating revocation. After the iddah of a third talaq, she becomes completely separated and cannot remarry him unless she first marries and divorces another man naturally (muhallil).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['iddah','divorce','waiting period','menstrual','pregnant','talaq']},
{id:'tl013',cat:'talaq',sub:'Iddah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the iddah (waiting period) after divorce?',a:'The iddah period in modern context: for most women, it is approximately three months (three menstrual cycles). During this time: (1) The woman cannot remarry, (2) In revocable divorce, the husband can reconcile, (3) If pregnancy is discovered, the marriage may be reconciled, (4) Financial maintenance continues. Important: a woman who was never intimate with her husband (before consummation) has no iddah — the divorce is immediate.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['iddah','divorce','waiting period','menstrual','pregnant','talaq']},
{id:'tl014',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce (khul)?',a:'Yes — khul is a divorce initiated by the wife when she is unwilling to continue the marriage. Process: (1) The wife expresses her unwillingness to continue, (2) She offers to return her mahr (or part of it, or another financial consideration) to the husband, (3) If the husband accepts, the khul divorce takes effect. The husband does not have to agree — if he refuses, the wife can petition a Sharia court (or the hakim shar\'i) who can compel the divorce if valid grounds exist (harm, neglect, abandonment, abuse).',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khul','divorce','woman','initiate','mahr','return']},
{id:'tl015',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce (khul)?',a:'Khul gives women an exit from marriage. She returns the mahr (or equivalent) and the marriage is dissolved. This is a recognized right in Islamic law. Beyond khul, a wife can seek divorce through the court on grounds of: husband\'s inability to provide, abandonment (prolonged absence), abuse, addiction, or other conditions that make continuation harmful. Islamic courts should provide access to divorce for women with legitimate grievances.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khul','divorce','woman','initiate','mahr','return']},
{id:'tl016',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'makarem',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce (khul)?',a:'Women\'s right to divorce is protected in Islam through multiple mechanisms: (1) Khul — wife returns mahr for divorce, (2) Court-ordered divorce — judge dissolves marriage based on valid grounds, (3) Contractual right — if the marriage contract includes delegation of divorce right to the wife, she can exercise it, (4) Defect — certain physical or mental defects give either spouse the right to annulment. A woman is not trapped in a harmful marriage — Islam provides multiple exit routes.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['khul','divorce','woman','initiate','mahr','return']},

{id:'tl017',cat:'talaq',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for a valid divorce?',a:'Conditions for valid talaq (divorce): (1) The husband pronounces the divorce formula (or his authorized agent), (2) Two just male witnesses are present, (3) The wife is not menstruating at the time (she must be in a state of taharat), (4) The husband and wife have not had intercourse during the current purity period, (5) The husband acts voluntarily and intentionally — divorce in anger without intention, under duress, or while intoxicated is invalid, (6) The specific formula must be recited in Arabic.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['talaq','divorce','conditions','formula','witnesses']},
{id:'tl018',cat:'talaq',sub:'Conditions',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the conditions for a valid divorce?',a:'Talaq requires: Arabic formula pronounced by the husband or his agent, presence of two just witnesses, the wife being in a state of purity (not menstruating), no sexual intercourse in the current purity period, and voluntary intention. Importantly: a divorce pronounced in extreme anger where the person loses control is invalid. Triple divorce in one sitting counts as ONE divorce in Shia law, not three — this differs from some Sunni positions.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['talaq','divorce','conditions','formula','witnesses']},
{id:'tl019',cat:'talaq',sub:'Conditions',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the conditions for a valid divorce?',a:'The strict conditions for divorce in Shia fiqh serve as safeguards against hasty decisions: requiring witnesses ensures the community knows, the purity condition creates a waiting period, the formula requirement prevents accidental divorce, and the voluntariness condition protects against coerced divorce. These conditions make Islamic divorce a deliberate, considered process rather than an impulsive act.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['talaq','divorce','conditions','formula','witnesses']},
{id:'tl020',cat:'talaq',sub:'Iddah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is iddah after divorce?',a:'Iddah is the mandatory waiting period after divorce during which the woman cannot remarry. For a divorced woman: three menstrual cycles (or three lunar months if she doesn\'t menstruate). For a pregnant woman: until delivery. For a widow: 4 months and 10 days. During revocable divorce (raj\'i) iddah, the husband may take her back without a new marriage. The husband must provide maintenance (nafaqah) during iddah of revocable divorce. Iddah serves multiple purposes: confirming pregnancy, allowing reconciliation, and providing transition time.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['iddah','waiting period','divorce','widow','pregnancy']},
{id:'tl021',cat:'talaq',sub:'Iddah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is iddah after divorce?',a:'Iddah protects women\'s rights and clarifies lineage. Duration: three complete menstrual cycles for divorced women with regular periods, three lunar months for those without periods, until delivery for pregnant women. During revocable divorce iddah, the woman stays in the marital home and the husband provides full nafaqah. He can take her back simply by saying so — no new mahr or contract is needed. After iddah expires, she is fully free.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['iddah','waiting period','divorce','widow','pregnancy']},
{id:'tl022',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce (khul)?',a:'Yes, a woman can initiate divorce through khul\' — a form where she gives up her mahr (or part of it) in exchange for divorce. This requires the husband\'s agreement. If the husband refuses and the wife suffers genuine hardship, she can petition a qualified mujtahid (hakim shar\'i) who can compel the divorce. Additionally, a woman can stipulate conditions in the marriage contract that grant her the right to divorce under specified circumstances.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khul','wife','divorce','initiate','woman','rights']},
{id:'tl023',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce (khul)?',a:'Women have the right to seek divorce through multiple channels: (1) Khul\' — she returns some or all of her mahr and the husband agrees, (2) Court-ordered divorce — if the husband is abusive, neglectful, imprisoned long-term, missing, or impotent, the court can grant divorce, (3) Conditional right in the marriage contract — she can stipulate the right to divorce under certain conditions at the time of marriage. The Islamic judiciary protects women\'s rights.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khul','wife','divorce','initiate','woman','rights']},
{id:'tl024',cat:'talaq',sub:'Khul',marja:'makarem',q:'Can a woman initiate divorce (khul)?',a:'Islam provides women with divorce options: khul\' (returning mahr for release), mubarat (mutual agreement to separate, each giving up claims), and judicial divorce for cause. The wife can also stipulate conditions in the marriage contract — for example, the right to divorce if the husband takes a second wife, becomes abusive, or fails to provide. These contractual conditions are binding and enforceable.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['khul','wife','divorce','initiate','woman','rights']},
