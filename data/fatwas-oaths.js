{id:'ot001',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath (Yamin)',marja:'sistani',q:'What makes an oath binding in Islam?',a:'A binding oath (yamin/qasam) requires: (1) Swearing by Allah (using names of God), (2) Verbal pronouncement (mere intention is insufficient), (3) The matter must be permissible — an oath to commit haram is void, (4) The person must be adult, sane, and acting voluntarily, (5) The oath must concern a future action (not past events). Breaking a valid oath requires kaffarah: freeing a slave (not applicable today), feeding 10 poor people, clothing 10 poor people, or fasting 3 consecutive days.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['oath','yamin','binding','kaffarah','allah']},
{id:'ot002',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath (Yamin)',marja:'khamenei',q:'What makes an oath binding in Islam?',a:'An oath is only binding when sworn by Allah or His names/attributes. Swearing by the Quran, the Prophet, or the Imams does not create a legally binding oath (though breaking such promises is morally wrong). The oath must concern something permissible and beneficial. An oath to do something haram is automatically void and should not be fulfilled.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['oath','yamin','binding','kaffarah','allah']},
{id:'ot003',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath (Yamin)',marja:'makarem',q:'What makes an oath binding in Islam?',a:'The binding oath requires Allah\'s name and verbal articulation. Oaths made under coercion, in anger without intention, or as habitual speech are not binding. If keeping an oath would cause harm to oneself or others, breaking it is permissible (even recommended) with kaffarah. Excessive oath-taking is discouraged in Islam.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['oath','yamin','binding','kaffarah','allah']},
{id:'ot004',cat:'oaths',sub:'Vow (Nadhr)',marja:'sistani',q:'How do vows (nadhr) work?',a:'A nadhr (vow) is a commitment to perform or abstain from something for Allah\'s sake, often conditional ("If Allah grants me X, I will do Y"). Requirements: (1) Verbal pronouncement using a specific formula, (2) The vowed act must be worship or beneficial, (3) It must not conflict with obligations, (4) Made voluntarily by an adult of sound mind. Once made, fulfilling a nadhr is obligatory. Breaking it without valid excuse requires kaffarah similar to breaking an oath.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['nadhr','vow','commitment','kaffarah','formula']},
{id:'ot005',cat:'oaths',sub:'Vow (Nadhr)',marja:'khamenei',q:'How do vows (nadhr) work?',a:'Nadhr becomes binding when properly formulated as a commitment to Allah. Common nadhr examples: fasting specific days, giving charity, performing pilgrimage, hosting religious gatherings. The vowed action must be religiously good or neutral — vowing to do something haram or harmful is void. A wife\'s nadhr does not require husband\'s permission according to most views, though it should not contradict his rights.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['nadhr','vow','commitment','kaffarah','formula']},
{id:'ot006',cat:'oaths',sub:'Vow (Nadhr)',marja:'safi',q:'How do vows (nadhr) work?',a:'Nadhr is a serious commitment before Allah. The formula traditionally used is "lillahi alayya" (for Allah, upon me). Conditional nadhr (if condition X, then I will do Y) only becomes binding when the condition is met. Fulfilling vows is emphasized in Quran: "They fulfill their vows" (76:7) is mentioned as a quality of the righteous.',source:'Hidayat al-Ibad / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['nadhr','vow','commitment','kaffarah','formula']},
{id:'ot007',cat:'oaths',sub:'Covenant (Ahd)',marja:'sistani',q:'What is a covenant (ahd) with Allah?',a:'An ahd (covenant) with Allah is similar to nadhr but uses the formula "I make a covenant with Allah (ahadtu ma\'allah)." It carries the same binding force and kaffarah for breaking. The covenanted action must be permissible and beneficial. Some scholars consider ahd as a category within nadhr. Fulfilling covenants is heavily emphasized in the Quran in multiple verses.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ahd','covenant','allah','commitment','binding']},
{id:'ot008',cat:'oaths',sub:'Covenant (Ahd)',marja:'makarem',q:'What is a covenant (ahd) with Allah?',a:'The covenant with Allah is a solemn commitment. Like nadhr, it must be verbalized with the proper formula. Breaking a covenant with Allah is a major sin if done without valid excuse. The Quran repeatedly condemns covenant-breakers. If fulfilling the covenant becomes genuinely impossible or harmful, it is excused, but kaffarah should be given.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['ahd','covenant','allah','commitment','binding']},
{id:'ot009',cat:'oaths',sub:'Kaffarah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the kaffarah for breaking an oath or vow?',a:'The kaffarah for breaking an oath is (in order of preference): (1) Feed 10 poor people (approximately 750g of food staple per person), (2) Clothe 10 poor people, (3) If unable to do either, fast 3 consecutive days. For breaking a nadhr, the kaffarah is the same as breaking an oath according to the well-known opinion. For breaking a covenant (ahd), the kaffarah is the same. If a person is unable to fulfill any kaffarah due to poverty, they should seek forgiveness from Allah.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['kaffarah','expiation','oath','feeding','fasting']},
{id:'ot010',cat:'oaths',sub:'Kaffarah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the kaffarah for breaking an oath or vow?',a:'Kaffarah for oath-breaking: feed or clothe 10 poor people, or fast 3 days. The feeding should provide a full day\'s meals. The clothing should be reasonably functional. The three days of fasting must be consecutive — if broken, restart. Monetary equivalent may be given in place of actual food/clothing in modern contexts.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['kaffarah','expiation','oath','feeding','fasting']},
{id:'ot011',cat:'oaths',sub:'Kaffarah',marja:'bashir',q:'What is the kaffarah for breaking an oath or vow?',a:'The kaffarah system serves as both expiation and deterrent. In South Asian contexts, many scholars accept monetary equivalent for feeding — approximately the cost of a day\'s meals for 10 people. This makes the obligation accessible while maintaining its significance. The person should also sincerely repent for breaking their commitment.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Ahkam',tags:['kaffarah','expiation','oath','feeding','fasting']},

{id:'ot012',cat:'oaths',sub:'Promises',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on breaking promises?',a:'Breaking a promise (wa\'d) is morally reprehensible and considered sinful when done without valid excuse. While a regular promise does not carry the same legal kaffarah as a formal oath (yamin), the Quran condemns those who say what they do not do (61:2-3). If one makes a promise and later finds it impossible to fulfill, they should explain and apologize. Habitually breaking promises is a sign of nifaq (hypocrisy) according to hadith.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['promise','breaking','hypocrisy','moral','binding']},
{id:'ot013',cat:'oaths',sub:'Promises',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on breaking promises?',a:'Fulfilling promises is an Islamic obligation. The Prophet (s) listed breaking promises among the signs of hypocrisy. While a promise lacks the formal structure of an oath (and thus the specific kaffarah), it is still morally and religiously binding. One who promises should make every effort to fulfill it. If unable, they should inform the other party and seek forgiveness.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['promise','breaking','hypocrisy','moral','binding']},
{id:'ot014',cat:'oaths',sub:'Promises',marja:'noori',q:'What is the ruling on breaking promises?',a:'The Quran repeatedly emphasizes keeping covenants and promises. "Fulfill your covenants; indeed covenants will be questioned about" (17:34). A Muslim\'s word should be their bond. Teaching children to keep promises builds character and trustworthiness. Breaking promises without excuse damages trust, relationships, and one\'s spiritual standing.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['promise','breaking','hypocrisy','moral','binding']},
{id:'ot015',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath in Court',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on taking oaths in non-Islamic courts?',a:'Taking an oath in a non-Islamic court is permissible if one is telling the truth. Swearing to tell the truth is actually aligned with Islamic principles. One should never take a false oath regardless of the setting — false oaths are major sins. If the oath formula uses "so help me God," this is acceptable. If asked to swear on a Bible, one may request to swear on the Quran instead, but the oath\'s validity depends on truthfulness, not the object.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['court','oath','testimony','truth','non-Islamic']},
{id:'ot016',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath in Court',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on taking oaths in non-Islamic courts?',a:'Testifying truthfully in any court — Islamic or civil — is an obligation. Taking a court oath to tell the truth is permissible and even commendable. False testimony is haram regardless of the context. Muslims in non-Muslim countries should participate in the justice system honestly. If one can swear by Allah rather than on a specific book, that is preferred, but the court oath is valid.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['court','oath','testimony','truth','non-Islamic']},
{id:'ot017',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath in Court',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on taking oaths in non-Islamic courts?',a:'Court oaths are valid when truthful. The important element is honesty, not the specific formula used. A Muslim should never give false testimony or take false oaths, whether in an Islamic court or a civil court. Perjury is a major sin with severe consequences in the hereafter. If asked to testify, one should do so truthfully even if it goes against their personal interest.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['court','oath','testimony','truth','non-Islamic']},
{id:'ot018',cat:'oaths',sub:'False Oath',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on swearing a false oath?',a:'Swearing a false oath (yamin ghamoos) — deliberately swearing by Allah to something one knows is untrue — is a major sin (kabirah). It is called "ghamoos" because it "drowns" the person in sin. Unlike breaking a valid oath, there is no specific kaffarah for a false oath; rather, sincere tawbah (repentance) is required. If the false oath caused harm to another person, restitution must also be made.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['false oath','ghamoos','sin','kabirah','repentance']},
{id:'ot019',cat:'oaths',sub:'False Oath',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on swearing a false oath?',a:'A false oath is among the major sins. The Prophet (s) warned that swearing falsely destroys homes and communities. If taken in court, it may lead to unjust rulings — the person bears the sin of the injustice caused. Repentance requires: stopping the sin, deep regret, commitment not to repeat, and compensating anyone harmed.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['false oath','ghamoos','sin','kabirah','repentance']},
{id:'ot020',cat:'oaths',sub:'False Oath',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on swearing a false oath?',a:'The Quran warns: "Do not take your oaths as means of deception" (16:94). A false oath undermines the entire social fabric of trust. In Islamic jurisprudence, it is among the sins that invite divine wrath in this world. The person must repent sincerely, make amends to those wronged, and never repeat such an act.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['false oath','ghamoos','sin','kabirah','repentance']},
{id:'ot021',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath Under Duress',marja:'sistani',q:'Is an oath made under coercion binding?',a:'An oath made under coercion (ikrah) is not binding. If someone is forced to swear against their will — whether through physical threat, intimidation, or unbearable pressure — the oath is void and no kaffarah is required for not fulfilling it. This is based on the hadith: "My ummah is forgiven for what they do under compulsion, by mistake, or what they forget."',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['coercion','duress','ikrah','forced','invalid']},
{id:'ot022',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath Under Duress',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is an oath made under coercion binding?',a:'Coerced oaths have no legal validity. The principle of la ikrah (no compulsion) applies. If a person is threatened with serious harm to themselves or their family and swears an oath, they are not bound by it. This applies to both religious and legal contexts. The coercer bears the sin.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['coercion','duress','ikrah','forced','invalid']},
{id:'ot023',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath Under Duress',marja:'safi',q:'Is an oath made under coercion binding?',a:'Free will is a prerequisite for all binding commitments in Islam. An oath extracted through torture, threats, blackmail, or extreme pressure is as if it was never made. The person should not feel guilty about not fulfilling such an oath. Historical examples from the lives of the Imams (as) demonstrate this principle.',source:'Hidayat al-Ibad / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['coercion','duress','ikrah','forced','invalid']},
{id:'ot024',cat:'oaths',sub:'Habitual Swearing',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on habitual or casual swearing by Allah?',a:'Habitual swearing by Allah in everyday speech (such as "wallahi" used casually) without serious intention is called laghw (idle) oath. It is not binding and carries no kaffarah. However, it is makruh (discouraged) to use Allah\'s name casually. The Quran says: "Allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths" (2:225). Muslims should cultivate reverence for Allah\'s name.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['habitual','casual','laghw','wallahi','swearing']},
{id:'ot025',cat:'oaths',sub:'Habitual Swearing',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on habitual or casual swearing by Allah?',a:'Casual "wallahi" in conversation without deliberate intention is not a binding oath. However, excessive casual use of Allah\'s name is disrespectful and should be avoided. Teaching children to say "wallahi" for trivial matters normalizes something that should be solemn. Better alternatives exist: "truly," "I assure you," etc.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['habitual','casual','laghw','wallahi','swearing']},
{id:'ot026',cat:'oaths',sub:'Habitual Swearing',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on habitual or casual swearing by Allah?',a:'Unintentional or habitual oaths are laghw and not binding. But Muslims should be mindful of how frequently they invoke Allah\'s name. The culture of swearing casually diminishes the gravity of genuine oaths. It is recommended to consciously reduce habitual swearing and reserve Allah\'s name for meaningful occasions.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['habitual','casual','laghw','wallahi','swearing']},
{id:'ot027',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath to Do Haram',marja:'sistani',q:'What if someone swears to do something haram?',a:'An oath to commit a haram act is automatically void (batil). Not only is it not binding, but fulfilling it is itself sinful. For example, if someone swears to never speak to their parents, or swears to harm someone, these oaths must be broken. No kaffarah is required for breaking such oaths — in fact, breaking them is obligatory. The person should repent for making such an oath in the first place.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['haram','void','batil','oath','sin']},
{id:'ot028',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath to Do Haram',marja:'khamenei',q:'What if someone swears to do something haram?',a:'Oaths to do haram or to abandon obligatory duties are void from inception. One must not fulfill them and no kaffarah is due. Similarly, an oath to do something makruh or to abandon something mustahab is not binding according to many scholars. The oath system is designed for positive commitments, not negative ones.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['haram','void','batil','oath','sin']},
{id:'ot029',cat:'oaths',sub:'Oath to Do Haram',marja:'makarem',q:'What if someone swears to do something haram?',a:'The principle is clear: no oath can make haram into halal or halal into haram. If someone rashly swears to commit a sin, they must not follow through. Examples: swearing to cut family ties, swearing never to pray, swearing to take revenge unjustly — all void. The correct response is to repent for the rash oath and do the right thing.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['haram','void','batil','oath','sin']},
{id:'ot030',cat:'oaths',sub:'Istikharah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is istikharah and how is it performed?',a:'Istikharah (seeking guidance from Allah) is performed when one faces a decision and is unable to determine the best course through rational analysis and consultation. Methods include: (1) Quran istikharah — opening the Quran randomly after prayer and dua, interpreting the verse, (2) Tasbeeh istikharah — using prayer beads with specific dua, (3) Simply praying two rakat and asking Allah for guidance. Istikharah should not replace rational decision-making but complement it.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['istikharah','guidance','quran','decision','prayer']},
{id:'ot031',cat:'oaths',sub:'Istikharah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is istikharah and how is it performed?',a:'Istikharah is a supplementary tool, not a replacement for thinking and consultation. The proper sequence: (1) Gather information, (2) Consult knowledgeable people, (3) Use your reason, (4) If still undecided, perform istikharah. Relying on istikharah for every trivial decision is not recommended. The most common method is the Quran istikharah performed by a scholar on one\'s behalf.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['istikharah','guidance','quran','decision','prayer']},
{id:'ot032',cat:'oaths',sub:'Istikharah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is istikharah and how is it performed?',a:'Istikharah literally means "seeking the best" from Allah. It should be used after exhausting rational means. The Quran method: perform two rakat prayer, recite the istikharah dua sincerely, then open the Quran randomly. The verse provides guidance. However, istikharah is not fortune-telling — it\'s seeking divine assistance in decision-making. It should not be overused or treated superstitiously.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['istikharah','guidance','quran','decision','prayer']},
{id:'ot033',cat:'oaths',sub:'I\'tikaf',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for i\'tikaf (spiritual retreat)?',a:'I\'tikaf is a recommended act of worship involving staying in a mosque for at least three days with the intention of worship. Conditions: (1) Must be in a congregational mosque, (2) Must be done with fasting (obligatory during i\'tikaf), (3) Minimum three consecutive days, (4) One must not leave the mosque except for necessities. The best time is the last ten days of Ramadan. During i\'tikaf, one should focus on prayer, Quran, dua, and self-reflection.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['itikaf','retreat','mosque','ramadan','worship']},
{id:'ot034',cat:'oaths',sub:'I\'tikaf',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules for i\'tikaf (spiritual retreat)?',a:'I\'tikaf is strongly recommended, especially in Ramadan. The person remains in the mosque for three days (minimum), fasting and devoted to worship. Leaving for emergencies, bathroom, and essential needs is permitted. I\'tikaf combined with fasting creates intense spiritual focus. Universities, seminaries, and mosques often organize group i\'tikaf programs.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['itikaf','retreat','mosque','ramadan','worship']},
{id:'ot035',cat:'oaths',sub:'I\'tikaf',marja:'noori',q:'What are the rules for i\'tikaf (spiritual retreat)?',a:'I\'tikaf is a spiritual retreat that disconnects from worldly distractions. The Prophet (s) regularly performed i\'tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. Modern i\'tikaf should include: turning off phones, minimizing conversation, intensive Quran study, tahajjud prayers, self-accounting (muhasabah), and seeking Laylat al-Qadr. It is a powerful tool for spiritual transformation.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['itikaf','retreat','mosque','ramadan','worship']},
