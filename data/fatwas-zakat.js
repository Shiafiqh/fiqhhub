{id:'z001',cat:'zakat',sub:'Obligation',marja:'sistani',q:'What items is zakat obligatory on?',a:'Zakat is obligatory on nine items: (1) Wheat. (2) Barley. (3) Dates. (4) Raisins (grapes that will become raisins). (5) Gold. (6) Silver. (7) Camels. (8) Cows. (9) Sheep/goats. Each has a specific minimum threshold (nisab) below which zakat is not due. For crops: approximately 847 kg. For gold: 20 mithqal (about 85 grams). For silver: 200 dirhams (about 595 grams). Livestock have specific numbers. Zakat al-fitrah at the end of Ramadan is a separate obligation on all Muslims for themselves and their dependents.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 1, Zakat',tags:['zakat','obligation','nine items','nisab']},
{id:'z002',cat:'zakat',sub:'Fitrah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is zakat al-fitrah and when is it due?',a:'Zakat al-fitrah is obligatory upon every Muslim who is baligh, sane, conscious, and financially capable (not destitute) at the time of sunset on the eve of Eid al-Fitr. They must pay for themselves and all their dependents (family members, guests, servants under their care at that time). The amount is one sa\' (approximately 3 kg) of common food staple per person — wheat, barley, rice, dates, or their monetary equivalent. It should be paid between sunset of the last day of Ramadan and the Eid prayer. If one does not pray Eid prayer, it should be paid before noon on Eid day.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1982',tags:['fitrah','zakat','eid','ramadan','obligation']},
{id:'z003',cat:'zakat',sub:'Fitrah',marja:'khamenei',q:'How much is zakat al-fitrah in monetary terms?',a:'The monetary value of zakat al-fitrah is equivalent to approximately 3 kg of the common food of the region (wheat, rice, barley, dates, etc.). The price varies by location and year. One should determine the current local price of 3 kg of the most common staple food (e.g., rice or wheat) and pay that amount per person. It is permissible to pay in cash rather than actual food. Some marjas announce a recommended amount each year. The payment should be made for each dependent, including children, even newborns present at sunset on the eve of Eid. A guest who arrives before sunset is included.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['fitrah','amount','money','calculation']},
{id:'z004',cat:'zakat',sub:'Distribution',marja:'makarem',q:'Who is eligible to receive zakat?',a:'Zakat can be given to the following eight categories mentioned in the Quran (9:60): (1) Fuqara — the poor who cannot meet their annual expenses. (2) Masakin — the destitute in more severe poverty. (3) Amilin — those employed to collect and distribute zakat. (4) Mu\'allafat al-Qulub — those whose hearts are to be reconciled (new Muslims or potential allies). (5) Riqab — freeing slaves. (6) Gharimin — those in debt who cannot repay. (7) Fi Sabil Allah — expenditure in the way of Allah (Islamic causes). (8) Ibn al-Sabil — stranded travelers. The recipient must be a Shia Muslim, not a Sayyid (Sayyids receive from khums, not zakat), and not a dependent of the giver.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['zakat','recipients','eligible','eight categories']},
{id:'z005',cat:'zakat',sub:'Gold & Silver',marja:'sistani',q:'When is zakat obligatory on gold?',a:'Zakat on gold is obligatory when the following conditions are met: (1) The gold reaches the first nisab of 20 mithqal shar\'i (approximately 85 grams of pure gold) — the zakat is 2.5%. (2) The gold has been in one\'s possession for a full lunar year. (3) The gold is in the form of coins that were or could be used as currency. (4) The owner is baligh and sane. Important: zakat on gold applies to gold coins/currency, not to jewelry or gold bars in contemporary usage according to most scholars. Gold jewelry worn by women is generally exempt from zakat in Shia fiqh, as it is personal use.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Zakat section',tags:['zakat','gold','nisab','coins','jewelry']},
{id:'z006',cat:'zakat',sub:'Crops',marja:'shirazi',q:'How is zakat calculated on agricultural produce?',a:'Zakat on crops (wheat, barley, dates, raisins) becomes due when the produce reaches the nisab of approximately 847 kg. The rate depends on the irrigation method: if irrigated by rain, rivers, or natural means — 10% (one-tenth); if irrigated by artificial means (wells, pumps, purchased water) — 5% (one-twentieth); if by a combination — 7.5%. Zakat becomes due at harvest time when the grain ripens or the fruit is ready to pick. Expenses of cultivation, harvesting, and transportation are not deducted before calculating zakat (unlike khums). The produce is estimated while still on the tree/field.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Zakat of Crops',tags:['zakat','crops','agriculture','irrigation','nisab']},
{id:'z007',cat:'zakat',sub:'Fitrah',marja:'wahid',q:'Must zakat al-fitrah be paid for a guest?',a:'If a guest arrives at your home before sunset on the eve of Eid al-Fitr and is considered your dependent for that night (eating at your table, staying as your guest), then yes, you are obligated to pay their fitrah. If the guest arrives after sunset, there is no obligation. If a person is a guest at someone else\'s home and the host pays their fitrah, it is sufficient and the guest does not need to pay separately. However, if there is doubt about whether the host will pay, it is better for the guest to pay their own as well, as a precaution.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['fitrah','guest','dependent','obligation']},
{id:'z008',cat:'zakat',sub:'Obligation',marja:'hakim',q:'Is there zakat on money and banknotes in Shia fiqh?',a:'In Shia jurisprudence, zakat is not obligatory on paper money (banknotes) or modern currencies. Zakat on monetary units is specifically for gold and silver coins that serve as currency. Since modern paper money and digital currencies are not gold or silver coins, they do not meet the criteria for the zakat of gold and silver. However, the concept of khums covers surplus wealth including money, making it a more comprehensive wealth tax in Shia practice. This is a key difference from Sunni jurisprudence, where many scholars apply zakat to modern money by analogy.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj, Zakat',tags:['zakat','money','banknotes','currency','difference']},
{id:'z009',cat:'zakat',sub:'Fitrah',marja:'najafi',q:'Can zakat al-fitrah be given to non-Muslims?',a:'Zakat al-fitrah, according to the majority of Shia scholars, should be given to Muslim recipients who fall within the eligible categories. It cannot be given to non-Muslims. The recipient should be a Shia Ithna-Ashari Muslim who is in need. It should not be given to someone who would use it for sinful purposes. It also cannot be given to a Sayyid. However, some scholars permit giving it to non-Muslims in the category of "those whose hearts are to be reconciled" (mu\'allafat al-qulub), but this is a minority position in contemporary Shia fiqh.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['fitrah','non-Muslim','recipients','eligibility']},
{id:'z010',cat:'zakat',sub:'Livestock',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the nisab thresholds for zakat on sheep?',a:'Zakat on sheep/goats has five nisab levels: (1) 40 sheep — 1 sheep is due. (2) 121 sheep — 2 sheep are due. (3) 201 sheep — 3 sheep are due. (4) 301 sheep — 4 sheep are due. (5) 400 and above — 1 sheep for every 100. Conditions: the sheep must have grazed freely on natural pasture for the entire year (not fed with purchased feed), the owner must have possessed them for a full lunar year, and they must not be working animals used for irrigation or plowing. The sheep given as zakat must be at least one year old and in reasonable health.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Zakat of Livestock',tags:['zakat','sheep','livestock','nisab','thresholds']},
{id:'z011',cat:'zakat',sub:'Fitrah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling if one forgets to pay zakat al-fitrah on time?',a:'If one forgets or is unable to pay zakat al-fitrah on time (between sunset of the last day of Ramadan and the Eid prayer/noon on Eid day), the obligation does not lapse. It should be paid as soon as one remembers or is able. However, after the time has passed, the intention shifts — one should make the intention of paying it as what is owed (ma fi al-dhimmah) rather than as ada (on-time performance). It is better to set the amount aside on the eve of Eid even if distribution is delayed. If one deliberately does not pay, it is sinful, but the obligation remains and must still be fulfilled.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['fitrah','late','forgotten','obligation']},
{id:'z012',cat:'zakat',sub:'Obligation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is zakat different from khums in Shia Islam?',a:'Yes, zakat and khums are distinct obligations. Zakat applies only to the nine specific items (wheat, barley, dates, raisins, gold coins, silver coins, camels, cows, sheep) and zakat al-fitrah. Khums (20%) applies to annual surplus income, minerals, treasure, and other categories. In practice, for most modern Muslims, khums is the primary wealth-related obligation since few people own the specific items subject to zakat (agricultural produce at nisab levels, livestock, gold/silver coins). Both are obligatory but serve different purposes — zakat primarily supports the poor, while khums is divided between the Imam\'s share and needy Sayyids.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['zakat','khums','difference','comparison','obligation']},
{id:'zk013',cat:'zakat',sub:'Modern Wealth',marja:'sistani',q:'Is zakat required on paper money and bank accounts?',a:'Classical zakat applies to 9 specific items: gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates, raisins, camels, cows, and sheep — when they reach the nisab (minimum threshold). Paper money is not directly subject to zakat in the classical sense. However, khums covers modern wealth forms. Some scholars recommend voluntary zakat (sadaqah) on paper money to fulfill the spirit of wealth redistribution. Zakat al-fitrah (at end of Ramadan) is obligatory on everyone and is typically about 3 kg of staple food or equivalent cash per person.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['zakat','money','bank','modern','obligation','paper']},
{id:'zk014',cat:'zakat',sub:'Modern Wealth',marja:'makarem',q:'Is zakat required on paper money and bank accounts?',a:'Classical zakat has specific items. However, the broader principle of wealth purification applies through khums (which covers all surplus income). Muslims should: (1) Pay khums on annual surplus — this is the primary wealth obligation, (2) Pay zakat al-fitrah before Eid al-Fitr, (3) Pay zakat on the 9 specific items if applicable (agricultural produce, livestock, gold/silver), (4) Give voluntary sadaqah generously. The comprehensive system of khums + zakat + sadaqah ensures wealth circulation in the Muslim community.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['zakat','money','bank','modern','obligation','paper']},
{id:'zk015',cat:'zakat',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the exact amount for zakat al-fitrah?',a:'Zakat al-fitrah is approximately 3 kg (one sa\') of the common food of your region (wheat, rice, barley, dates, etc.) or its monetary equivalent for each person in the household. It must be paid for: yourself, your spouse, your children, your parents if they are your dependents, and any person (including guests) who is your dependent on the night of Eid. It should be paid before Eid prayer; if delayed, on obligatory precaution, it should still be paid with the intention of qurbah.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['fitrah','zakat','eid','amount','food','obligation']},
{id:'zk016',cat:'zakat',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the exact amount for zakat al-fitrah?',a:'One sa\' (approximately 3 kg) per person of the predominant food of your country. The amount in cash fluctuates based on food prices — check your marja\'s website or local Islamic center for the current year\'s amount. Pay for every dependent: family members, servants, guests who stayed the night of Eid. It should reach the poor before Eid prayer. If set aside but not yet delivered, it must reach the recipient soon. It cannot be given to non-Muslims or to Sayyids (from non-Sayyids).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['fitrah','zakat','eid','amount','food','obligation']},
{id:'zk017',cat:'zakat',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the exact amount for zakat al-fitrah?',a:'Practical fitrah guide: (1) Check your marja\'s website for this year\'s amount — it changes annually based on food prices, (2) Count all household members including guests, (3) Pay before Eid prayer time, (4) Can be given to any needy Muslim (not a Sayyid, unless you are also a Sayyid), (5) Islamic centers often collect fitrah and distribute it — this is a convenient option, (6) If you set the money aside before Eid but distribute it after, it is valid.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['fitrah','zakat','eid','amount','food','obligation']},

{id:'zk018',cat:'zakat',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is Zakat al-Fitrah?',a:'Zakat al-Fitrah is obligatory on every Muslim who is: adult, sane, and not poor (has provisions for the year). It must be paid on Eid al-Fitr eve for oneself and every dependent (wife, children, guests who ate iftar at one\'s home on the last night of Ramadan). The amount is approximately 3kg of common food staple (wheat, rice, dates) OR its monetary equivalent per person. It must be paid before Eid prayer; delaying beyond Eid day makes it qada.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['zakat','fitrah','eid','obligatory','food']},
{id:'zk019',cat:'zakat',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is Zakat al-Fitrah?',a:'Fitrah is wajib on Eid al-Fitr for oneself and all dependents. One sa\' (approximately 3kg) of local staple food per person. It should be given to deserving poor Shia Muslims. The payment should be made before Eid prayer. If no deserving recipient is found locally, the amount can be set aside and distributed when possible. It is separate from khums and other financial obligations.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['zakat','fitrah','eid','obligatory','food']},
{id:'zk020',cat:'zakat',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is Zakat al-Fitrah?',a:'Zakat al-Fitrah purifies the fasting person from any shortcomings during Ramadan and provides for the poor on Eid day. Amount: approximately 3kg of staple food per person, including all dependents. In modern practice, paying the monetary equivalent is common and acceptable. Recipients are the same eight categories eligible for regular zakat, with priority given to needy believers in one\'s community.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['zakat','fitrah','eid','obligatory','food']},
{id:'zk021',cat:'zakat',sub:'Recipients',marja:'sistani',q:'Who can receive zakat?',a:'The eight Quranic categories (9:60) eligible for zakat: (1) The poor (faqir), (2) The destitute (miskin), (3) Zakat collectors/administrators, (4) Those whose hearts are being reconciled (new Muslims, potential allies), (5) Freeing slaves, (6) Those in debt (who cannot repay), (7) In the way of Allah (Islamic causes, education, infrastructure), (8) The stranded traveler (ibn al-sabil). Sayyids (descendants of the Prophet) cannot receive regular zakat — they receive from khums instead.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['zakat','recipients','categories','poor','quran']},
{id:'zk022',cat:'zakat',sub:'Recipients',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who can receive zakat?',a:'The Quranic categories cover a wide range of social needs. In modern application: the poor, indebted individuals, Islamic educational institutions, community development projects, orphanages, and stranded travelers. The prohibition on Sayyids receiving zakat is maintained — they have their share from khums. Zakat distribution should prioritize local needs before distant causes.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['zakat','recipients','categories','poor','quran']},
