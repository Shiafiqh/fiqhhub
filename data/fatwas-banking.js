{id:'bk001',cat:'banking',sub:'Interest',marja:'sistani',q:'Is taking a mortgage to buy a house permissible?',a:'Conventional mortgages involving riba (interest) are problematic. However, several solutions exist: (1) Islamic mortgages structured as diminishing musharakah (partnership where the bank\'s share gradually decreases), murabahah (cost-plus sale), or ijarah (lease-to-own) are permissible. (2) For conventional mortgages in non-Muslim countries where Islamic alternatives are unavailable: some scholars permit it under necessity, especially for the primary family home, viewing the bank as a non-Muslim entity and applying the rule that riba restrictions may differ with non-Muslim parties. (3) This is based on the view that paying interest to a non-Muslim bank is not the same as between Muslims. (4) One should seek Islamic financing options first.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['mortgage','house','interest','riba','Islamic finance']},
{id:'bk002',cat:'banking',sub:'Islamic Banking',marja:'khamenei',q:'How does Islamic banking differ from conventional banking?',a:'Islamic banking operates on principles that avoid riba: (1) Mudarabah — profit-sharing where the bank provides capital and the client provides expertise; profits are shared by pre-agreed ratio, losses borne by the bank. (2) Musharakah — joint partnership in a venture with shared profits and losses. (3) Murabahah — the bank buys an asset and sells it to the client at a disclosed markup with installments. (4) Ijarah — leasing. (5) Sukuk — Islamic bonds representing ownership in an asset. The key principle: money itself cannot generate money (no guaranteed interest). Returns must come from real economic activity with shared risk. In Islamic countries like Iran, the banking system is structured on these principles.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['Islamic banking','mudarabah','musharakah','murabahah','conventional']},
{id:'bk003',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'makarem',q:'Is using credit cards permissible?',a:'Using credit cards is permissible if: (1) You pay the full balance within the grace period (no interest charged) — this is simply a convenience tool and is fine. (2) If interest is charged on the balance, this is riba and is problematic. (3) In non-Muslim countries, some scholars permit using credit cards even with potential interest, based on the principle regarding transactions with non-Muslim financial entities. (4) The best practice is to pay off the full balance monthly to avoid interest entirely. (5) Cash advance fees and late payment penalties that constitute interest should be avoided. Using a credit card responsibly as a payment tool (rather than for borrowing at interest) is clearly permissible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['credit card','permissible','interest','riba','payment']},
{id:'bk004',cat:'banking',sub:'Interest',marja:'sistani',q:'What should one do with interest earned on bank accounts?',a:'Interest received from bank accounts should be handled carefully: (1) If you stipulated interest as a condition when depositing, receiving it is riba. (2) If the bank pays interest/profit without stipulation, it can be received. (3) For interest from non-Muslim banks: many scholars permit keeping it as there is a view that riba prohibition between Muslims and non-Muslims has different application. (4) For interest from Muslim banks in Islamic countries: it should be accepted as profit-sharing (mudarabah) returns. (5) If one wishes to be cautious, the interest can be given to the poor or used for public benefit — not as khums or zakat, but as returning "unknown owner" funds (majhul al-malik) with the permission of the marja.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['interest','bank','accounts','riba','handling']},
{id:'bk005',cat:'banking',sub:'Investment',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is investing in mutual funds and index funds halal?',a:'Investing in mutual funds and index funds requires examining the underlying holdings: (1) The fund must primarily invest in halal businesses — not alcohol, gambling, conventional banking, pork, weapons, or entertainment companies whose primary business is haram. (2) Index funds that track broad market indices will inevitably include some haram companies — scholars differ on whether this invalidates the entire investment. (3) Some scholars permit it if the majority of holdings are halal, while advising to donate the proportional earnings from haram companies. (4) Islamic mutual funds that screen for shariah compliance are the best option. (5) Bond funds that pay fixed interest are more problematic than equity funds.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mutual funds','index funds','investment','halal','screening']},
{id:'bk006',cat:'banking',sub:'Insurance',marja:'hakim',q:'Is life insurance a form of gambling?',a:'Life insurance is not gambling because: (1) Gambling requires chance-based outcome where one party wins and another loses on a wager. Insurance is a risk-sharing agreement. (2) The premium pays for genuine coverage against specified risks — this has real value even if no claim is ever made. (3) Islamic scholars who permit insurance view it as a legitimate sulh (settlement) or mu\'awadah (exchange) contract. (4) The policyholder receives the peace of mind of coverage, which is a service. (5) However, some scholars recommend takaful (Islamic cooperative insurance) as the ideal alternative, where participants contribute to a pool and any surplus is returned or donated. Standard insurance is permissible but takaful is preferred.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['life insurance','gambling','permissible','takaful','risk']},
{id:'bk007',cat:'banking',sub:'Debt',marja:'najafi',q:'Is it permissible to take on debt for non-essential purchases?',a:'Taking on debt is permissible but should be done responsibly: (1) The debt must not involve riba. (2) Debt for genuine needs (home, education, medical expenses, starting a business) is more justified. (3) Debt for non-essential luxury purchases is permissible but discouraged, especially if repayment may cause hardship. (4) One must have a realistic plan to repay — taking debt with no intention or ability to repay is akin to usurping others\' wealth. (5) Narrations indicate that dying in debt without means to repay is a serious matter. (6) If one has surplus wealth and debts, paying debts takes priority over recommended spending. Living within one\'s means is an Islamic virtue.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['debt','permissible','necessity','luxury','repayment']},
{id:'bk008',cat:'banking',sub:'Zakat al-Fitrah',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can zakat and religious dues be paid via bank transfer?',a:'Yes, paying zakat, khums, fitrah, and other religious dues via bank transfer is permissible. The method of payment does not affect the validity of the obligation — what matters is that the correct amount reaches the intended recipient or authorized representative. Electronic transfers, online payments, and mobile payments are all valid means. It is advisable to specify the purpose of the transfer (e.g., khums, sahm al-imam, sahm al-sadat, fitrah) and keep records. If paying to a marja\'s office, follow their specified channels. The receipt of payment serves as documentation.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['bank transfer','zakat','khums','payment','electronic']},
{id:'bk009',cat:'banking',sub:'Islamic Banking',marja:'sistani',q:'What is murabahah financing and is it truly interest-free?',a:'Murabahah is a sale-based financing method: the bank purchases an asset at the client\'s request, then sells it to the client at a known markup, payable in installments. For it to be genuinely Islamic: (1) The bank must actually own the asset (even briefly) before selling. (2) The markup must be disclosed and agreed upon. (3) The sale must involve a real asset — not just moving money. (4) If structured as a mere formality to disguise interest (the bank never actually purchases or owns the asset), it becomes a form of hidden riba. Critics argue some murabahah products are economically equivalent to interest loans. The key is the genuine transfer of ownership and real trade transaction, not just paperwork.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['murabahah','Islamic finance','markup','interest-free','validity']},
{id:'bk010',cat:'banking',sub:'Charity',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it better to give charity publicly or privately?',a:'Both public and private charity have merits: (1) Private charity (sadaqah in secret) is generally superior as it protects the recipient\'s dignity and keeps the giver\'s intention pure (for Allah alone). (2) Public charity can be better when it encourages others to give and establishes a social norm of generosity. (3) For obligatory dues (khums, zakat, fitrah) — these can be given publicly without issue. (4) For voluntary charity — private is preferred unless there is a specific benefit in making it public. (5) Showing off (riya\') invalidates the spiritual reward of charity. (6) The Quran mentions both: "If you disclose your charity, it is good; but if you conceal it and give it to the poor, that is better for you" (2:271).',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['charity','public','private','sadaqah','reward']},
{id:'bk011',cat:'banking',sub:'Interest',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on paying interest on loans?',a:'Paying riba (interest) is also haram, but in cases of necessity (like mortgage for essential housing), there is scholarly discussion. The prohibition on riba is primarily on the lender/charger of interest. For the borrower: if there is genuine need and no interest-free alternative, some scholars permit borrowing with interest as a last resort. The sin falls primarily on the one who charges interest. However, one should exhaust all halal alternatives first and not be comfortable with interest-based transactions.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['riba','interest','loan','mortgage','banking','haram','necessity']},
{id:'bk012',cat:'banking',sub:'Interest',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on paying interest on loans?',a:'Both giving and taking riba are prohibited. However, in non-Muslim countries where Muslims often have no choice but to use interest-based banking, the ruling has nuance. If a Muslim needs a home loan and Islamic financing is unavailable, many scholars permit taking a conventional mortgage as a necessity. The key is: (1) genuine need, (2) no halal alternative available, (3) not taking more than necessary. Muslims should actively support the development of Islamic banking alternatives.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['riba','interest','loan','mortgage','banking','haram','necessity']},
{id:'bk013',cat:'banking',sub:'Interest',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on paying interest on loans?',a:'The prohibition on riba is one of the most severe in Islam — the Quran declares war from Allah and His Messenger against those who deal in riba. For borrowers in genuine need: necessity permits what is otherwise forbidden. If you need a mortgage to house your family and no Islamic mortgage is available, many scholars permit it with the intention to transition to Islamic financing when available. Unnecessary interest-bearing transactions (credit card interest from overspending, luxury loans) have no excuse.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['riba','interest','loan','mortgage','banking','haram','necessity']},
{id:'bk014',cat:'banking',sub:'Interest',marja:'safi',q:'What is the ruling on paying interest on loans?',a:'Riba is absolutely forbidden whether giving or receiving. In cases of genuine necessity in non-Muslim countries, one may take interest-based loans for essential needs (housing, medical, education) when Islamic alternatives don\'t exist. This is based on the principle of necessity (dharurah). One should maintain the intention to move to Islamic banking when possible and should never be comfortable with interest-based dealings.',source:'Hidayat al-Ibad / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['riba','interest','loan','mortgage','banking','haram','necessity']},
{id:'bk015',cat:'banking',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on cryptocurrency trading?',a:'Cryptocurrency as a concept is a new phenomenon without direct classical precedent. The general principles apply: if the cryptocurrency has real value in the market and is used as a medium of exchange, trading it is permissible like trading any other commodity. However: (1) Speculative trading that amounts to gambling is haram, (2) Using crypto for money laundering or illegal purposes is haram, (3) The high volatility means one should not risk essential family funds. Mining cryptocurrency is permissible if it doesn\'t involve theft of electricity or resources.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','halal','speculation','digital']},
{id:'bk016',cat:'banking',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on cryptocurrency trading?',a:'Cryptocurrency trading is permissible in principle if it has genuine market value. However, the speculative nature of many cryptocurrencies raises concerns. Trading that is purely speculative (like gambling) is not permissible. If one uses cryptocurrency as an investment based on research and analysis (like stock trading), it is more acceptable. Government regulations should be respected. The environmental impact of mining should also be considered from an Islamic ethics perspective.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','halal','speculation','digital']},
{id:'bk017',cat:'banking',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on cryptocurrency trading?',a:'Cryptocurrency is evaluated like any financial instrument: if it has genuine value, utility, and a real market, trading it is halal. The concerns are: (1) Extreme speculation bordering on gambling — buying random tokens hoping for 100x gains is problematic, (2) Pyramid/Ponzi schemes using crypto are clearly haram, (3) Money laundering is haram regardless of the medium. Investing in established cryptocurrencies with proper research, risk management, and not risking essential funds is generally permissible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','halal','speculation','digital']},
{id:'bk018',cat:'banking',sub:'Insurance',marja:'sistani',q:'Is conventional insurance permissible?',a:'Insurance contracts are permissible in principle — they can be categorized as a valid contract (aqd) between two parties where one pays a premium for financial protection. The key is that it must not involve gharar (excessive uncertainty) that renders it gambling-like. Conventional insurance in its standard modern form is generally accepted as permissible since it is a widespread commercial practice with regulated terms. Takaful (Islamic insurance) is preferred when available as it avoids any doubtful elements.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['insurance','halal','permissible','takaful','risk','contract']},
{id:'bk019',cat:'banking',sub:'Insurance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is conventional insurance permissible?',a:'Insurance is permissible as it serves a legitimate social need for risk management. Health insurance, vehicle insurance, property insurance, and life insurance are all accepted. The contract is between the policyholder and the company — it is a binding agreement for mutual benefit. In the Islamic Republic, the insurance industry operates within an Islamic framework. In non-Muslim countries, conventional insurance is permitted for Muslims as it falls under valid commercial contracts.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['insurance','halal','permissible','takaful','risk','contract']},
{id:'bk020',cat:'banking',sub:'Insurance',marja:'makarem',q:'Is conventional insurance permissible?',a:'Insurance is halal. It is a modern contract form that serves legitimate purposes: protecting families from financial catastrophe, covering medical expenses, and managing risk. The comparison to gambling is incorrect — insurance involves real risk management, actuarial science, and mutual benefit. Car insurance, health insurance, home insurance, and business insurance are all permissible. Life insurance that pays out to beneficiaries is also halal and can be considered a form of providing for one\'s family.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['insurance','halal','permissible','takaful','risk','contract']},
{id:'bk021',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'sistani',q:'Can Muslims use credit cards?',a:'Credit cards are permissible if: (1) The balance is paid in full each month — avoiding interest charges. (2) The card is not used for haram purchases. If one carries a balance and pays interest, the interest portion is haram. However, using a credit card as a payment tool (paying full balance monthly) is perfectly fine and involves no riba. Rewards and cashback from credit cards are halal as they are given by the card company from their merchant fees, not from interest.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['credit card','interest','halal','payment','riba','balance']},
{id:'bk022',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can Muslims use credit cards?',a:'Credit cards as a payment mechanism are permissible. The prohibition applies to the interest charged on unpaid balances. If a Muslim uses a credit card and pays the full balance before the due date (no interest incurred), this is completely halal. Cash advances that charge interest from day one should be avoided. The convenience and security of credit cards make them a practical tool when used responsibly — the key is never carrying an interest-bearing balance.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['credit card','interest','halal','payment','riba','balance']},
{id:'bk023',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'makarem',q:'Can Muslims use credit cards?',a:'Credit cards in themselves are simply a payment tool — halal. The problem arises only when interest is paid on outstanding balances. Practical advice: (1) Set up autopay for the full balance each month, (2) Never spend more than you can pay off, (3) Cash rewards and points are halal, (4) If you accidentally incur interest, pay it off immediately and resolve not to repeat it. Some Islamic banks offer Sharia-compliant credit cards that charge fees instead of interest — these are ideal when available.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['credit card','interest','halal','payment','riba','balance']},

{id:'bk024',cat:'banking',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency?',a:'Cryptocurrency trading is permissible if it involves a real exchange of value and is not purely speculative gambling. The currency must have real market value and the transaction must be transparent. Mining cryptocurrency is permissible as it involves computational work. However, using crypto for money laundering, purchasing haram goods, or evading legitimate taxes is haram.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','digital','permissible']},
{id:'bk025',cat:'banking',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency?',a:'Cryptocurrency is a developing area of fiqh. If it functions as a genuine medium of exchange with real value, transactions are permissible. Pure speculation (buying solely hoping price rises without any utility) resembles gambling and is problematic. The government has the right to regulate cryptocurrency to protect citizens and the economy. Using crypto to circumvent sanctions or for illegal purposes is forbidden.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','digital','permissible']},
{id:'bk026',cat:'banking',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency?',a:'Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are permissible for trading when treated as digital assets with real value. The same rules of trade apply: both parties must agree on terms, no fraud or deception, and the asset must be clearly defined. Extreme volatility makes some forms of crypto trading resemble gambling — caution is advised. Investing amounts one can afford to lose is wiser than speculating with essential savings.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['cryptocurrency','bitcoin','trading','digital','permissible']},
{id:'bk027',cat:'banking',sub:'Riba',marja:'sistani',q:'Why is riba (interest/usury) forbidden?',a:'Riba is forbidden by Quran (2:275-279), Sunnah, and scholarly consensus. It creates: exploitation of the needy, concentration of wealth, economic instability, and social injustice. In Islamic economics, money should not generate money without productive activity. The lender shares no risk while the borrower bears all risk — this is fundamentally unjust. Islamic alternatives (mudarabah, musharakah) distribute risk and reward more equitably.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['riba','interest','forbidden','economics','justice']},
{id:'bk028',cat:'banking',sub:'Riba',marja:'khamenei',q:'Why is riba (interest/usury) forbidden?',a:'The prohibition of riba protects economic justice. Interest-based systems: enrich the wealthy at the expense of the poor, create debt traps, incentivize hoarding over productive investment, and destabilize economies through credit bubbles. Islamic finance requires the financier to share risk — in mudarabah (profit sharing) and musharakah (joint venture), both profit and loss are shared, creating more just economic relationships.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['riba','interest','forbidden','economics','justice']},
{id:'bk029',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'sistani',q:'Is using credit cards permissible?',a:'Using credit cards is permissible if one pays the full balance before interest accrues. The credit card itself is a convenience tool — a short-term interest-free loan. Once interest charges begin, they constitute riba and are haram. Therefore: use credit cards for convenience, pay in full each month, never carry an interest-bearing balance. Cash-back and rewards from credit cards are permissible as they come from the merchant, not from riba.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['credit card','interest','riba','payment','permissible']},
{id:'bk030',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is using credit cards permissible?',a:'Credit cards are permissible when used as a payment method without incurring interest. If one pays the balance in full by the due date, no riba is involved. Carrying a balance and paying interest is riba and prohibited. In cases of genuine necessity where no alternative exists, some scholars allow limited use with the firm intention to pay off as quickly as possible. Rewards and cashback are halal.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['credit card','interest','riba','payment','permissible']},
{id:'bk031',cat:'banking',sub:'Credit Cards',marja:'makarem',q:'Is using credit cards permissible?',a:'The permissibility depends on usage: paying in full monthly — halal; carrying interest-bearing balance — haram. Muslims should use credit cards as a convenience tool, not a borrowing mechanism. If one struggles with overspending, using debit cards or cash is advisable. The discipline to avoid riba through credit cards is a practical aspect of Islamic financial consciousness.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['credit card','interest','riba','payment','permissible']},
