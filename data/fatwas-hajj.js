{id:'h001',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'sistani',q:'When does Hajj become obligatory?',a:'Hajj becomes obligatory (wajib) once in a lifetime upon a Muslim who is: (1) Baligh (reached puberty). (2) Sane (aqil). (3) Financially able — possessing enough funds for travel, accommodation, and expenses while maintaining provision for dependents back home. (4) Physically able to travel and perform the rites. (5) The route is safe. (6) There is sufficient time to reach Makkah. Once these conditions are met, Hajj becomes immediately obligatory and must not be delayed.

{id:'h002',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can Hajj be performed on behalf of a deceased person?',a:'Yes, Hajj can be performed on behalf of a deceased person if they had the financial ability during their lifetime but did not perform Hajj. In such a case, it is obligatory to arrange Hajj from their estate before distributing inheritance. If the deceased had already performed their obligatory Hajj, a recommended (mustahab) Hajj can be performed on their behalf for spiritual reward. The person performing Hajj on behalf of another (na\'ib) must themselves have already performed their own obligatory Hajj.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['hajj','deceased','behalf','niyabah']},

(2) Al-Juhfah — for people from Syria, Egypt, and North Africa. (3) Qarn al-Manazil — for people from Najd and the east. (4) Yalamlam — for people from Yemen and the south. (5) Dhat Irq — for people from Iraq. For those whose route does not pass through any miqat, they should enter ihram when parallel to (muhazat) the nearest miqat. For Umrah Mufradah, one can also enter ihram from Adna al-Hill (the nearest point outside the Haram boundary).',source:'Anwar al-Fiqahah, Manasik',tags:['miqat','ihram','locations','hajj']},
{id:'h005',cat:'hajj',sub:'Tawaf',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for a valid tawaf?',a:'The conditions for a valid tawaf around the Ka\'bah are: (1) Intention (niyyah) specifying which tawaf (e.g., tawaf al-ziyarah).

{id:'h006',cat:'hajj',sub:'Sa\'y',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on sa\'y between Safa and Marwa?',a:'Sa\'y (walking) between Safa and Marwa is an obligatory rite consisting of seven courses: starting from Safa to Marwa (1st course), then Marwa to Safa (2nd course), and so on, ending at Marwa on the 7th course. The person must walk; riding is only permitted for those unable to walk. One should walk with normal pace, though it is recommended for men to run (harwalah) in the middle section between the green markers. Sa\'y does not require wudu, though it is recommended. If one loses count, and the doubt is not resolvable, the sa\'y is invalid and must be restarted.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['say','safa','marwa','hajj','rites']},
{id:'h007',cat:'hajj',sub:'Arafat',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the wuquf (standing) at Arafat?',a:'Wuquf at Arafat is an essential pillar (rukn) of Hajj. The pilgrim must be present in the plain of Arafat from noon (zuhr) on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah until sunset. The obligatory amount is even a brief presence during this time, but the recommended practice is to remain the entire afternoon in supplication and worship. Missing Arafat entirely invalidates the Hajj. If one arrives late but catches even a moment before sunset, the Hajj is valid. The pilgrim should remain within the boundaries of Arafat and not enter the surrounding mountains.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj, Wuquf',tags:['arafat','wuquf','standing','dhul-hijjah']},
{id:'h008',cat:'hajj',sub:'Muzdalifah',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rites at Muzdalifah?',a:'After leaving Arafat at sunset on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, pilgrims proceed to Muzdalifah (Mash\'ar al-Haram) where they must stay overnight and be present from Fajr until sunrise on the 10th. Collecting pebbles for the rami (stoning) is done here. The obligatory wuquf is a brief presence between Fajr and sunrise. Women, elderly, and those with valid excuses may leave after midnight. This wuquf is a pillar of Hajj — missing it without excuse can invalidate the Hajj. The night should be spent in worship and remembrance.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['muzdalifah','mashar','wuquf','pebbles']},
{id:'h009',cat:'hajj',sub:'Mina',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rites on the Day of Eid (10th Dhul-Hijjah) in Mina?',a:'On the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah in Mina, three rites must be performed in order: (1) Rami al-Jamrah al-Aqabah — throwing seven pebbles at the largest pillar, each with takbir. (2) Animal sacrifice (hady) — slaughtering a sheep, goat, cow, or camel. The animal must meet specific age and health requirements. (3) Halq or taqsir — men should shave the head (halq) for the first Hajj, or at minimum cut some hair (taqsir). Women cut a small portion of their hair. After these, most ihram prohibitions are lifted except sexual relations, which remain prohibited until tawaf al-nisa.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj, Mina rites',tags:['mina','eid','sacrifice','rami','halq']},

(3) It must not have broken horns exposing the interior. (4) Its ears should not be cut off. (5) It should be castrated is acceptable. The sacrifice must be performed in Mina during the days of Eid (10th-13th Dhul-Hijjah).

{id:'h011',cat:'hajj',sub:'Tawaf',marja:'shirazi',q:'What is tawaf al-nisa and is it obligatory?',a:'Tawaf al-nisa is a specific tawaf unique to Shia jurisprudence that must be performed after tawaf al-ziyarah and its prayer, and after sa\'y. It consists of seven rounds around the Ka\'bah followed by two rak\'at of prayer. It is obligatory for both men and women. Without performing tawaf al-nisa, sexual relations with one\'s spouse remain forbidden even after completing all other Hajj rites. If a person forgets or is unable, they must either return to perform it or appoint someone to do it on their behalf. This applies to both Hajj and Umrah Mufradah.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Hajj',tags:['tawaf','nisa','obligatory','sexual','ihram']},
{id:'h012',cat:'hajj',sub:'Rami',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for stoning the pillars (rami)?',a:'Rami al-jamarat involves throwing pebbles at the pillars in Mina: (1) On the 10th, only the largest pillar (Jamrah al-Aqabah) is stoned with 7 pebbles. (2) On the 11th and 12th (and 13th for those required to stay), all three pillars are stoned — first the smallest, then middle, then largest — with 7 pebbles each. Conditions: pebbles must be small stones from the Haram area (not Mina itself), they must hit the pillar or its base, each throw must be separate (not all at once), and the thrower must be certain of hitting the target. It should be done between sunrise and sunset.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['rami','stoning','pillars','jamarat','mina']},
{id:'h013',cat:'hajj',sub:'Umrah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the difference between Umrah Tamattu and Umrah Mufradah?',a:'Umrah Tamattu is part of Hajj al-Tamattu — it must be performed before Hajj in the months of Hajj (Shawwal, Dhul-Qa\'dah, Dhul-Hijjah). Its rites are: ihram from miqat, tawaf, prayer of tawaf, sa\'y, and taqsir. After taqsir, one exits ihram and remains in Makkah for Hajj. Umrah Mufradah is an independent worship not connected to Hajj. It can be performed any time during the year. Its rites include: ihram, tawaf, prayer, sa\'y, taqsir, tawaf al-nisa, and its prayer. Umrah Tamattu does not have tawaf al-nisa.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['umrah','tamattu','mufradah','difference','hajj']},
{id:'h014',cat:'hajj',sub:'Ihram',marja:'wahid',q:'Can a menstruating woman enter ihram?',a:'Yes, a menstruating woman can and should enter ihram at the miqat. Menstruation does not prevent ihram. She recites the talbiyah and observes all ihram prohibitions. However, she cannot perform tawaf or its prayer until she is tahir and has performed ghusl. If her hajj schedule does not allow waiting, there are specific rulings for each situation — she may need to delay tawaf or perform it with tayammum according to the scholarly opinion. She can perform sa\'y, wuquf at Arafat, Muzdalifah, and Mina rites normally.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['ihram','menstruation','women','hajj','tawaf']},
{id:'h015',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to delay Hajj for financial planning?',a:'Once the conditions of Hajj obligation (istita\'ah) are met — including financial ability, physical health, and safe travel — Hajj must be performed in the very first year it becomes obligatory. Delaying it without a legitimate shariah-recognized excuse is haram (forbidden) and constitutes a major sin. Financial planning for future convenience is not a valid excuse if one already has sufficient funds. The obligation is immediate (fawri). If one delays and then loses the ability, they are liable and must perform Hajj as soon as ability returns, even if it requires borrowing (when repayment is realistic).',source:'Anwar al-Fiqahah',tags:['hajj','delay','obligation','istita\'ah','sin']},
{id:'h016',cat:'hajj',sub:'Tawaf',marja:'hakim',q:'What invalidates tawaf?',a:'Tawaf is invalidated by: (1) Losing wudu — if this occurs during tawaf, one must perform wudu and, if less than half was completed, restart; if more than half, resume from where one stopped. (2) Not maintaining the Ka\'bah on the left side. (3) Entering Hijr Isma\'il instead of going around it. (4) Going outside the mataaf area. (5) Not completing seven rounds. (6) Not starting/ending at Hajar al-Aswad. (7) Significant deviation from the circular path. Doubt about the number of rounds: if doubt occurs after completing the set, it is ignored; if during tawaf with no way to resolve it, the tawaf is invalid.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['tawaf','invalidation','wudu','conditions']},
{id:'h017',cat:'hajj',sub:'Sacrifice',marja:'najafi',q:'Can the Hajj sacrifice money be given as charity instead?',a:'No, the animal sacrifice on the day of Eid in Mina is an obligatory rite that cannot be substituted with charity. The actual slaughtering of an animal is required. However, after slaughtering, the meat should ideally be divided into three parts: one-third for the pilgrim, one-third as gifts, and one-third for the poor. If one cannot find an animal in Mina, they should fast 10 days instead — 3 days during Hajj (7th, 8th, 9th Dhul-Hijjah or after) and 7 days after returning home. Modern slaughterhouse projects that distribute meat to the poor are acceptable as long as a specific animal is designated and slaughtered for you.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['sacrifice','charity','substitution','meat']},
{id:'h018',cat:'hajj',sub:'Umrah',marja:'khamenei',q:'How many times can Umrah Mufradah be performed?',a:'Umrah Mufradah can be performed multiple times — there is no limit. Each Umrah is a recommended act of worship with great reward. However, scholars differ on the minimum interval between two Umrahs. As an obligatory precaution, there should be at least a month (30 days) between two Umrah Mufradahs if performed for oneself. However, one can perform Umrah on behalf of different people consecutively. The recommended practice is to perform Umrah whenever one visits the sacred sites, as it carries immense spiritual merit.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['umrah','mufradah','multiple','frequency']},
{id:'h019',cat:'hajj',sub:'Ihram',marja:'hamedani',q:'What is the talbiyah and when must it be recited?',a:'The talbiyah is the declaration recited upon entering ihram: "Labbayk Allahumma labbayk, labbayk la sharika laka labbayk, innal-hamda wan-ni\'mata laka wal-mulk, la sharika lak." It means: "Here I am O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Indeed all praise, bounty, and sovereignty are Yours; You have no partner." Reciting talbiyah is obligatory for establishing ihram — without it, ihram is not established. It should be recited at the miqat after making the intention and putting on ihram garments. It is recommended to recite it frequently until the relevant stopping point.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['talbiyah','ihram','recitation','hajj']},
{id:'h020',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'saafi',q:'What is Hajj al-Tamattu and who must perform it?',a:'Hajj al-Tamattu is the type of Hajj obligatory upon those who live more than 88 km (48 miles) from Makkah. It consists of two parts: (1) Umrah al-Tamattu — performed first with ihram, tawaf, prayer, sa\'y, and taqsir. (2) Hajj al-Tamattu — performed afterwards with ihram from Makkah, wuquf at Arafat, wuquf at Muzdalifah, rites at Mina, tawaf al-ziyarah, prayer, sa\'y, tawaf al-nisa, and its prayer. Those living within 88 km perform Hajj al-Qiran or Hajj al-Ifrad instead. The Umrah and Hajj must be performed in the same year.',source:'Jami al-Ahkam, Hajj',tags:['tamattu','hajj','types','obligation','distance']},
{id:'h021',cat:'hajj',sub:'Tawaf',marja:'sistani',q:'Can tawaf be performed on the upper levels of Masjid al-Haram?',a:'The designated area for tawaf (mataaf) is the ground floor area around the Ka\'bah. Performing tawaf on the upper floors or roof of Masjid al-Haram is a matter of scholarly debate. According to the obligatory precaution, tawaf should be performed at the ground level in the traditional mataaf area. If this is not possible due to extreme crowding or physical disability, performing it on upper levels may be permissible as a matter of necessity, but one should, as a precaution, also repeat it at the ground level when possible.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['tawaf','upper floors','masjid al-haram','mataaf']},
{id:'h022',cat:'hajj',sub:'Ihram',marja:'tabrizi',q:'What type of clothing must be worn during ihram?',a:'For men, the ihram clothing consists of two pieces of unstitched cloth: (1) Izar — wrapped around the waist covering from navel to below the knees. (2) Rida — placed over the shoulders covering the upper body. The cloths must be white, tahir, and not made of pure silk or material from haram animals. Men cannot wear any stitched clothing, underwear, socks, or items with buttons/zippers. Women wear their normal modest clothing for ihram — the stitching prohibition applies only to men. Women should not cover their faces and must not wear gloves, but they must maintain hijab from non-mahram men.',source:'Siraat al-Najah, Hajj',tags:['ihram','clothing','men','women','unstitched']},
{id:'h023',cat:'hajj',sub:'Sacrifice',marja:'sistani',q:'What if one cannot afford the Hajj sacrifice?',a:'If a pilgrim performing Hajj al-Tamattu cannot afford to purchase a sacrificial animal, the alternative is to fast 10 days: 3 days during the Hajj period (the 7th, 8th, and 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, or if missed, three consecutive days after Eid starting from the 11th) and 7 consecutive days after returning home. The 3 days and 7 days should not be joined — there should be a gap between them (the gap of travel). If one cannot fast the 3 days during Hajj, they fast all 10 after returning.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['sacrifice','unable','fasting','alternative']},
{id:'h024',cat:'hajj',sub:'Umrah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on visiting the graves of the Imams in Madinah?',a:'Visiting (ziyarah) the grave of Prophet Muhammad (s) in Madinah and the graves of the Imams in Baqi cemetery is highly recommended and carries immense spiritual reward. While not an obligatory part of Hajj, scholars strongly encourage combining Hajj with ziyarah of the Prophet\'s mosque and grave. The recommended acts include: entering with adab, reciting salam and specific ziyarah prayers, praying in Masjid al-Nabi (especially in the Rawdah area), and visiting the graves of the Imams in Baqi. This is a deeply cherished practice in Shia tradition.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj, Ziyarah section',tags:['ziyarah','madinah','prophet','imams','baqi']},
{id:'h025',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'shirazi',q:'Can Hajj funds be used to pay off debts first?',a:'If a person has debts, the situation depends: (1) If the debt is due immediately and the creditor demands payment, paying the debt takes priority and the person is not considered mustati (able) for Hajj until both the debt can be paid and Hajj funds are available. (2) If the debt is long-term with installments and the person can manage both installment payments and Hajj expenses without hardship, Hajj is obligatory. (3) If performing Hajj would mean defaulting on debts, clearing the debt comes first. The key principle is that Hajj obligation requires financial ability after accounting for essential debts and family maintenance.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Hajj',tags:['hajj','debt','priority','financial','istita\'ah']},
{id:'h026',cat:'hajj',sub:'Tawaf',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one use a wheelchair for tawaf?',a:'Yes, a person who is unable to walk due to illness, disability, or extreme old age may perform tawaf in a wheelchair pushed by another person. The person in the wheelchair must have the intention of tawaf, and they must observe the conditions such as starting from Hajar al-Aswad, keeping the Ka\'bah on their left, and completing seven rounds. If even sitting in a wheelchair is not possible, another person can carry them or, as a last resort, perform tawaf on their behalf. The obligation of tawaf is not waived due to physical inability.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj',tags:['tawaf','wheelchair','disability','hajj']},
{id:'h027',cat:'hajj',sub:'Ihram',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the penalty for hunting during ihram?',a:'Hunting land animals during ihram is strictly prohibited. If a muhrim (person in ihram) hunts, the penalties vary by animal: for hunting an ostrich, the kaffarah is one camel; for a wild cow/deer, one cow; for a gazelle/rabbit/fox, one sheep. For smaller animals, there are specific amounts of food to give as charity. Insects and vermin that pose a threat (lice, scorpions, snakes) may be killed if necessary. Fishing (sea creatures) is permitted during ihram. Deliberately hunting larger animals may, in some cases, invalidate the Hajj if done knowingly.',source:'Manasik al-Hajj, Kaffarah',tags:['hunting','ihram','penalty','kaffarah','animals']},
{id:'h028',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'wahid',q:'Is a woman required to have a mahram for Hajj?',a:'A woman does not require a mahram companion as a condition for the obligation of Hajj. If she is financially and physically able, and the route is safe, Hajj is obligatory upon her even if no mahram is available to accompany her. The condition is safety of the journey, which can be ensured through traveling with reliable groups or companions even without a mahram. However, if the journey is genuinely unsafe without a mahram and no other means of ensuring safety exists, then she is excused until safety can be arranged. The key is the safety of the route, not the presence of a mahram per se.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['hajj','women','mahram','travel','obligation']},
{id:'hj029',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'sistani',q:'When does Hajj become obligatory?',a:'Hajj becomes obligatory once in a lifetime when all conditions are met simultaneously: (1) Bulugh (puberty), (2) Sanity, (3) Financial ability — can afford travel, accommodation, and provisions while maintaining family obligations at home, (4) Physical ability — can endure the journey, (5) Time — sufficient time to reach Mecca and perform the rites, (6) Safety of the route. If these conditions are met and one delays without excuse, Hajj remains obligatory and must be fulfilled even if conditions later change. One who dies without fulfilling obligatory Hajj must have it performed from their estate.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hajj','obligatory','conditions','financial','once']},
{id:'hj030',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'khamenei',q:'When does Hajj become obligatory?',a:'Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and becomes obligatory when one has the financial and physical means. "Financial ability" means: travel costs, accommodation, provisions, plus sufficient funds to maintain dependents during absence and have a livelihood to return to. Taking a loan to perform Hajj is not obligatory — but if one has savings earmarked for non-essential purposes, they should use them for Hajj. Delaying obligatory Hajj is a major sin.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hajj','obligatory','conditions','financial','once']},
{id:'hj031',cat:'hajj',sub:'Obligation',marja:'makarem',q:'When does Hajj become obligatory?',a:'Once the conditions for Hajj are met, it must be performed at the first available opportunity. Delay is sinful. Modern context: if you can afford a Hajj package, have no debts that would be neglected, and your family is provided for — Hajj is obligatory upon you. Saving for other goals (bigger house, luxury car) while neglecting Hajj is not acceptable.

{id:'hj032',cat:'hajj',sub:'Umrah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the difference between Hajj and Umrah?',a:'Umrah is the "lesser pilgrimage" that can be performed any time of year, while Hajj has fixed dates (8th-13th Dhul Hijjah). Umrah al-Mufradah (standalone Umrah) consists of: ihram, tawaf, prayer of tawaf, sa\'i between Safa and Marwa, taqsir (cutting hair/nails). Umrah al-Tamattu\' is performed as the first part of Hajj al-Tamattu\' (obligatory for those living far from Mecca). Hajj includes additional rites: Arafat, Muzdalifah, Mina, rami (stoning), sacrifice, and additional tawaf and sa\'i.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hajj','umrah','difference','tamattu','pilgrimage']},
{id:'hj033',cat:'hajj',sub:'Umrah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the difference between Hajj and Umrah?',a:'Umrah can be performed year-round and is simpler. Hajj al-Tamattu\' (the type for most people) begins with Umrah in the months of Hajj, then after exiting ihram, one enters ihram again for Hajj on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah. The distinction matters because Umrah alone doesn\'t fulfill the Hajj obligation.

{id:'hj035',cat:'hajj',sub:'Ihram',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the prohibitions during ihram?',a:'The ihram prohibitions create a state of spiritual focus and equality. All pilgrims — rich and poor — wear the same simple white garments (for men: two unstitched cloths). The restrictions remove vanity, worldly attachments, and distractions. Key prohibitions: no fragrance, no stitched clothes (men), no head covering (men), no face covering (women), no hunting, no sexual activity, no arguments.

(2) Men prepare two white unstitched cloths. (3) No razors or hair removal. (4) Replace perfumed deodorant with unscented. (5) Avoid arguments — this is perhaps the most commonly violated prohibition. (6) Be gentle with insects — don\'t swat flies.

Conditions: wudu/tahara, covering awrah, circumcision (for men), starting and ending at the Black Stone, keeping Ka\'bah on the left, including Hijr Ismail in the circuit, being on foot (unless unable).

Begin at the Black Stone or parallel to it, proceed counterclockwise. The crowd may push you off course — try your best to maintain the correct path. If you lose count of circuits, take the lesser number. After 7 circuits, pray 2 rak\'ahs behind Maqam Ibrahim (or anywhere in the mosque if the space near Maqam is too crowded).

(3) If wudu breaks during tawaf, leave, renew wudu, and continue from where you stopped (if in the first 3.5 rounds, restart; if past halfway, continue from where you stopped on some opinions).

The pilgrim must be present in the plains of Arafat during this time, engaged in du\'a, dhikr, and repentance. It is called the "greatest day" because it is when Allah\'s mercy descends most intensely. The Prophet (s) said: "Hajj is Arafat" — emphasizing its centrality.

It is a rehearsal for the Day of Judgment. The best use of this time is sincere du\'a, tawbah (repentance), and supplication for the ummah.

The Prophet (s) said Allah descends to the nearest heaven and boasts to the angels: "Look at My servants — they have come to Me disheveled and dusty, seeking My mercy. Bear witness that I have forgiven them." This is the moment every pilgrim works toward.

It must be healthy, not blind, not lame, not having broken horns (from the inside), and not too thin. Seven people can share one cow or camel.

(2) Sacrifice — slaughtering the animal. (3) Halq or taqsir — shaving the head (men, recommended) or cutting some hair/nails (women, and men who choose taqsir). After these three, most ihram prohibitions are lifted. Then the pilgrim goes to Mecca for tawaf, prayer of tawaf, sa\'i, and tawaf al-nisa.

The head shaving represents humility and rebirth. After completing the 10th\'s rites in Mina, pilgrims return to Mecca for the remaining tawaf and sa\'i, then back to Mina for 11th and 12th.
