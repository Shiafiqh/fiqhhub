A rental contract for use in haram activities (renting a building for alcohol production) is void.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ijarah','rental','contract','conditions','lease']},
{id:'ij002',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Rental Contracts',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the conditions for a valid rental contract?',a:'Ijarah conditions include: specification of the property, defined duration, agreed price, and lawful use. Both parties are bound by the terms once the contract is concluded. The landlord cannot arbitrarily evict during the lease period, and the tenant must use the property only as agreed. Sub-leasing is permissible unless explicitly prohibited in the contract.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['ijarah','rental','contract','conditions','lease']},
{id:'ij003',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Rental Contracts',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the conditions for a valid rental contract?',a:'The rental contract is binding on both parties. Key points: the landlord must deliver the property in usable condition, major repairs are the landlord\'s responsibility unless agreed otherwise, the tenant must not cause damage beyond normal wear, and the rent must be paid on time. Both parties should document the agreement to prevent disputes.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['ijarah','rental','contract','conditions','lease']},
{id:'ij004',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Employment',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the Islamic rules for employment contracts?',a:'Hiring someone (ijarah of labor) requires: (1) Specification of the work to be done, (2) Duration or scope of work, (3) Agreed wage/salary, (4) The work must be halal. Withholding wages is haram — the Prophet (s) said: "Pay the worker before his sweat dries." Exploitation, underpayment, and unsafe working conditions violate Islamic principles. The employer-employee relationship involves mutual rights and obligations.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['employment','wages','labor','contract','rights']},
{id:'ij005',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Employment',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the Islamic rules for employment contracts?',a:'Islamic labor ethics include: fair wages, safe working conditions, reasonable hours, dignity of the worker, and timely payment. Employers are responsible for workplace safety. Workers must fulfill their duties faithfully. Labor unions and collective bargaining have a basis in Islamic principles of seeking justice. Minimum wage laws align with Islamic emphasis on fair compensation.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['employment','wages','labor','contract','rights']},
{id:'ij006',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Employment',marja:'noori',q:'What are the Islamic rules for employment contracts?',a:'The dignity of labor is emphasized in Islam — the Prophet (s) kissed the calloused hands of workers. Islamic employment ethics include: no exploitation, prompt payment, just treatment, respect for workers\' dignity, provision of breaks for prayer, and concern for the worker\'s wellbeing. Underpaying workers is mentioned as one of the sins that reaches Allah swiftly.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['employment','wages','labor','contract','rights']},

Working in companies where the primary business is halal but some peripheral activities are haram requires careful evaluation.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['forbidden','work','haram','employment','halal']},
{id:'ij008',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Forbidden Work',marja:'makarem',q:'What types of work are forbidden (haram)?',a:'The general principle: any work whose primary purpose involves haram is itself haram. Working in halal companies where some incidental haram occurs (like a grocery store selling alcohol) is a matter of evaluation — if the worker\'s specific role doesn\'t involve the haram activity, it may be permissible, though it\'s better to avoid it. Working in essential services (hospitals, utilities) is permissible regardless of who benefits.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['forbidden','work','haram','employment','halal']},

{id:'ij009',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Tenant Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the tenant\'s rights in Islamic law?',a:'The tenant has the right to: (1) Use the property for the agreed purpose without interference, (2) A habitable and maintained property — the landlord must make major repairs, (3) Not be evicted during the lease term without valid cause, (4) Sub-lease unless explicitly prohibited in the contract, (5) Fair treatment and respect. The landlord cannot enter the property without permission during the lease period. Unjust eviction is a violation of the contract.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tenant','rights','rental','landlord','property']},
{id:'ij010',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Tenant Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the tenant\'s rights in Islamic law?',a:'Islamic law protects tenants: the lease is a binding contract that both parties must honor. The landlord cannot raise rent mid-lease, cannot enter without notice and permission, and must maintain the structural integrity of the property. The tenant must pay rent on time, use the property as agreed, and not cause damage. Disputes should be resolved through mediation or an Islamic authority.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['tenant','rights','rental','landlord','property']},
{id:'ij011',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Tenant Rights',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the tenant\'s rights in Islamic law?',a:'Tenant rights include: peaceful enjoyment of the property, proper maintenance by the landlord, privacy and non-interference, and protection from arbitrary eviction.

{id:'ij012',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Insurance',marja:'sistani',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islamic law?',a:'Insurance contracts are permissible in principle when structured properly. They can be viewed as a form of mutual agreement where one party pays a premium and the other agrees to cover specified losses.

Many contemporary scholars accept conventional insurance as permissible, especially when it is legally required (car insurance) or protects against significant financial risk.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['insurance','permissible','contract','takaful','risk']},
{id:'ij013',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Insurance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islamic law?',a:'Insurance is permissible as a binding contract between parties. It falls under general contract principles (uqud). Life insurance, health insurance, car insurance, and property insurance are all valid.

{id:'ij014',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Insurance',marja:'makarem',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islamic law?',a:'Insurance is essentially a contract of mutual guarantee and is permissible. The premium paid is consideration for the protection received. It is recommended to have health insurance and property insurance to protect one\'s family from unexpected financial burden. When Islamic insurance alternatives exist, they are preferred, but conventional insurance is valid especially for essential coverage.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['insurance','permissible','contract','takaful','risk']},
{id:'ij015',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Intellectual Property',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on intellectual property rights?',a:'Intellectual property rights are recognized and respected in Islamic law under the general principles of ownership and rights. Authorship, invention, and creative work give the creator rights over their work. Piracy, unauthorized copying, and plagiarism violate these rights. If the law of the land protects intellectual property, Muslims must respect these laws as part of honoring contracts and agreements. Scholars\' religious works may have different considerations based on the author\'s intent.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['intellectual property','copyright','piracy','rights','ownership']},
{id:'ij016',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Intellectual Property',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on intellectual property rights?',a:'Intellectual property is a legitimate right in Islamic jurisprudence. Copyright, patents, and trademarks are valid forms of ownership. Violating these rights — through piracy, counterfeiting, or unauthorized reproduction — is haram as it constitutes usurpation of another\'s property. Respecting the law of the land regarding IP is obligatory. Software piracy, movie piracy, and book piracy are all forms of theft.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['intellectual property','copyright','piracy','rights','ownership']},
{id:'ij017',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Intellectual Property',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on intellectual property rights?',a:'The right of a creator to benefit from their creation is upheld in Islam. Intellectual property including software, books, music (halal content), inventions, and artistic works belongs to their creators. Unauthorized copying for profit is clearly haram. For personal use, scholars differ, but respecting the creator\'s rights and the law is the safer and more ethical position.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['intellectual property','copyright','piracy','rights','ownership']},
{id:'ij018',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Insurance',marja:'sistani',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islam?',a:'Insurance contracts are permissible in Shia jurisprudence. They can be structured as a form of mutual cooperation or as a valid contract where one party provides financial protection in exchange for premiums. Health insurance, car insurance, and life insurance are all permissible. The key is that the contract terms are clear, fair, and free from excessive gharar (uncertainty). Insurance companies should invest premiums in halal ventures.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['insurance','permissible','takaful','contract','risk']},
{id:'ij019',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Insurance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islam?',a:'Insurance is permissible as a modern contract form.

{id:'ij020',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Insurance',marja:'makarem',q:'Is insurance permissible in Islam?',a:'Insurance is a valid contract in Islamic law. It provides security against unforeseen losses and is a form of mutual assistance. Different types (life, health, property, liability) are all permissible.

Muslims should obtain necessary insurance coverage to protect themselves and their families from financial hardship.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['insurance','permissible','takaful','contract','risk']},
{id:'ij021',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Intellectual Property',marja:'sistani',q:'Does Islam recognize intellectual property rights?',a:'Intellectual property rights are recognized in Islamic law under the principle of respecting people\'s labor and creativity. Copyrights, patents, and trademarks are valid rights that should be respected. Pirating software, books, or media is not permissible as it violates the creator\'s rights. However, knowledge that is essential for public welfare (like lifesaving medical information) may have different considerations.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['intellectual property','copyright','patent','piracy','rights']},
{id:'ij022',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Intellectual Property',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does Islam recognize intellectual property rights?',a:'Intellectual property is protected in Islamic law. Creative works, inventions, and original ideas belong to their creators. The principle "people have authority over their property" extends to intellectual products. Software piracy, book piracy, and unauthorized copying are forms of usurpation (ghasb). Creators deserve fair compensation for their work.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['intellectual property','copyright','patent','piracy','rights']},
{id:'ij023',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Intellectual Property',marja:'makarem',q:'Does Islam recognize intellectual property rights?',a:'Islam protects the rights of creators and inventors.

The exception is genuinely essential knowledge that shouldn\'t be monopolized.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['intellectual property','copyright','patent','piracy','rights']},
{id:'ij024',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Working for Non-Muslims',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible to work for non-Muslim employers?',a:'Working for non-Muslim employers is permissible as long as the work itself is halal. The employer\'s religion does not affect the permissibility of the employment. Conditions: the work must not involve haram activities, the employee must be able to fulfill their religious obligations (prayer, fasting), and the employment should not compromise Islamic values. Many companions of the Imams (as) worked in non-Muslim environments.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['non-muslim','employer','work','permissible','halal']},
{id:'ij025',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Working for Non-Muslims',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to work for non-Muslim employers?',a:'Employment under non-Muslim employers is fully permissible. What matters is the nature of the work, not the identity of the employer. Muslims have worked in diverse environments throughout history. The employee should: maintain their religious practice, represent Islam well through their character, negotiate for prayer breaks if needed, and refuse any task that conflicts with their faith.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['non-muslim','employer','work','permissible','halal']},
{id:'ij026',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Working for Non-Muslims',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to work for non-Muslim employers?',a:'There is no prohibition on working for non-Muslim employers. The key criteria are: halal work, ability to practice one\'s faith, and dignified treatment. In modern economies, the religious affiliation of the employer is not a jurisprudential concern. What matters is the halal nature of the work and fair treatment of the worker.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['non-muslim','employer','work','permissible','halal']},
{id:'ij027',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Freelancing',marja:'sistani',q:'What Islamic guidelines apply to freelance work?',a:'Freelancing follows the same principles as employment: the work must be halal, terms must be clear, and payment must be agreed upon. Specific concerns: (1) Both parties should honor the agreement, (2) The freelancer must deliver quality work as promised, (3) The client must pay promptly and fairly, (4) Unclear specifications should be clarified before starting. A freelancer offering services must be honest about their capabilities.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['freelancing','self-employment','contract','digital','work']},
{id:'ij028',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Freelancing',marja:'makarem',q:'What Islamic guidelines apply to freelance work?',a:'Freelancing is a valid form of ijarah (hiring of skills/labor).

Online freelancing platforms that facilitate clear contracts align with Islamic emphasis on written agreements.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['freelancing','self-employment','contract','digital','work']},
{id:'ij029',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Unions',marja:'sistani',q:'Is forming labor unions permissible?',a:'Labor unions that seek fair wages, safe working conditions, and workers\' rights are permissible and even praiseworthy in Islam. The principle of defending one\'s rights and standing against oppression supports collective action. However, unions should not cause undue harm to employers or the public (e.g., strikes affecting essential services without justification). Both workers and employers have rights that must be balanced.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['unions','labor','workers','rights','collective']},
{id:'ij030',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Unions',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is forming labor unions permissible?',a:'Workers have the right to organize and advocate for their interests collectively. This aligns with Islamic principles of justice and mutual consultation (shura). Labor movements that fight exploitation are essentially practicing amr bil ma\'ruf. The Islamic system seeks balance between workers\' rights and economic productivity for the common good.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['unions','labor','workers','rights','collective']},
{id:'ij031',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Tipping',marja:'sistani',q:'Is tipping obligatory or recommended?',a:'Tipping is not religiously obligatory but is recommended as a form of generosity (ihsan). In cultures where tipping is customary and workers rely on tips as part of their income, withholding tips can be considered unjust if the service was adequate. The Prophet (s) said: "Give the worker his wages before his sweat dries." If tips are an expected part of compensation, they become morally obligatory.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['tipping','generosity','ihsan','service','wages']},
{id:'ij032',cat:'ijarah',sub:'Tipping',marja:'makarem',q:'Is tipping obligatory or recommended?',a:'Tipping is mustahab (recommended) as it shows appreciation for service. In economies where tips constitute a significant portion of workers\' income, it becomes closer to obligatory. Generosity beyond what is required is praised in Islam. The Quran says: "And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good" (2:195). Tipping generously when one can afford it is a praiseworthy act.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['tipping','generosity','ihsan','service','wages']},
