{id:'tq001',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Obligation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is taqlid (following a Marja) obligatory?',a:'For a non-mujtahid (someone who cannot derive rulings independently from Islamic sources), taqlid is obligatory in matters of fiqh. Every Muslim must either be a mujtahid themselves, follow a qualified mujtahid (marja al-taqlid), or act on precaution (ihtiyat) in all matters. Taqlid applies only to practical rulings (furu al-din), NOT to beliefs (usul al-din) — core beliefs must be based on personal conviction and understanding.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['taqlid','obligatory','marja','mujtahid','following']},
{id:'tq002',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Obligation',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is taqlid (following a Marja) obligatory?',a:'Taqlid is wajib for non-mujtahids. The logic is like following a medical expert for health — you follow a qualified specialist in religious law for religious practice. The marja must be the most knowledgeable (a\'lam) according to obligatory precaution. Taqlid in beliefs is not accepted — every Muslim must understand and believe in core doctrines through their own reasoning.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['taqlid','obligatory','marja','mujtahid','following']},
{id:'tq003',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Obligation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is taqlid (following a Marja) obligatory?',a:'Taqlid is obligatory based on rational principle and Islamic law. Just as people consult experts in every field of life, they must consult the most qualified expert in Islamic law for practical rulings. This is not blind following — the muqallid (follower) must verify the qualifications of their marja and can question and seek explanations for rulings.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['taqlid','obligatory','marja','mujtahid','following']},
{id:'tq004',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Choosing a Marja',marja:'sistani',q:'How should one choose a Marja al-Taqlid?',a:'The marja must possess: (1) Ijtihad — highest level of Islamic legal scholarship, (2) Justice (adalah) — consistent piety and avoidance of sin, (3) Being alive (following a deceased marja has conditions), (4) Being male (on obligatory precaution), (5) Born legitimate, (6) Sanity and maturity. On the basis of obligatory precaution, one should follow the most knowledgeable (a\'lam). The a\'lam is determined through: testimony of two just scholars, personal knowledge if capable, or widespread reputation among scholars.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['choosing','marja','a'lam','qualifications','selection']},
{id:'tq005',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Choosing a Marja',marja:'khamenei',q:'How should one choose a Marja al-Taqlid?',a:'Selecting a marja requires investigation (tahqiq). One should consult knowledgeable scholars and seminary students about who is a\'lam. The markers include: published risalah (book of practical rulings), recognition by the hawza (seminary), scholarly works, students they have trained, and reputation among peers. One should not choose based on ethnicity, politics, or popularity alone.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['choosing','marja','a'lam','qualifications','selection']},
{id:'tq006',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Choosing a Marja',marja:'makarem',q:'How should one choose a Marja al-Taqlid?',a:'The process of choosing a marja should be taken seriously. Consulting multiple trustworthy scholars, examining the marja\'s published works, understanding their methodology, and confirming their scholarly reputation are all important. If two scholars are equally knowledgeable, one may choose either. Switching from one living marja to another is permissible if one becomes convinced the new one is more knowledgeable.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['choosing','marja','a'lam','qualifications','selection']},
{id:'tq007',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Switching Marja',marja:'sistani',q:'Can one switch from one Marja to another?',a:'Switching from one living marja to another is permissible if the person becomes convinced (through reliable evidence) that the new marja is more knowledgeable. Switching without such evidence is problematic. Actions performed correctly according to the previous marja remain valid — one does not need to repeat them. In matters where the new marja differs, one follows the new marja going forward.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['switching','marja','taqlid','change','a'lam']},
{id:'tq008',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Switching Marja',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one switch from one Marja to another?',a:'Switching is allowed when there is valid reason — primarily if the person determines another marja is more knowledgeable. Random switching without justification is not appropriate. Past actions performed according to the previous marja are valid. If one discovers their marja lacks qualifications, they must switch immediately.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['switching','marja','taqlid','change','a'lam']},
{id:'tq009',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Switching Marja',marja:'makarem',q:'Can one switch from one Marja to another?',a:'Switching marjas should be based on scholarly grounds, not convenience or personal preference for easier rulings. "Taqlid shopping" — choosing rulings from different marjas to find the easiest option — is not permissible. However, genuine scholarly inquiry leading to a change is perfectly valid.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['switching','marja','taqlid','change','a'lam']},
{id:'tq010',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Deceased Marja',marja:'sistani',q:'Can one continue following a deceased Marja?',a:'Continuing to follow a deceased marja (baqa\' ala taqlid al-mayyit) is permissible with the authorization of a living mujtahid. There are two scenarios: (1) The person had already begun following the marja before their death — continuing is permissible on the basis of obligatory precaution with a living marja\'s permission, (2) Beginning taqlid of a deceased marja for the first time — not permissible. The living marja\'s authorization bridges the transition.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['deceased','marja','continuing','baqa','permission']},
{id:'tq011',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Deceased Marja',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one continue following a deceased Marja?',a:'Remaining on a deceased marja\'s taqlid is permissible in matters where one had already learned and practiced their rulings. For new issues that arise, one must refer to a living marja. Starting fresh taqlid of a deceased marja is not allowed.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['deceased','marja','continuing','baqa','permission']},
{id:'tq012',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Deceased Marja',marja:'safi',q:'Can one continue following a deceased Marja?',a:'Continuing with a deceased marja is permissible, especially if they were a\'lam. The wisdom is that knowledge doesn\'t expire with death — their rulings remain valid. Many followers of Ayatollah al-Khoei (d. 1992) continued his taqlid with permission from living scholars. The key is having a living marja\'s endorsement.',source:'Hidayat al-Ibad / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['deceased','marja','continuing','baqa','permission']},

{id:'tq013',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Ihtiyat',marja:'sistani',q:'What does ihtiyat wajib (obligatory precaution) mean?',a:'When a Marja\' states a ruling as "obligatory precaution" (ihtiyat wajib or al-ahwat wujuban), it means: (1) He does not issue it as a definitive fatwa but recommends the precautionary action, (2) The follower MUST either follow this precaution OR refer to the next most knowledgeable Marja\' on that specific issue. This is different from ihtiyat mustahab (recommended precaution) which is optional. Understanding this distinction is crucial for practical taqlid.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ihtiyat','precaution','obligatory','mustahab','taqlid']},
{id:'tq014',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Ihtiyat',marja:'khamenei',q:'What does ihtiyat wajib (obligatory precaution) mean?',a:'Ihtiyat wajib indicates the Marja\' has not reached a definitive conclusion but the precautionary position is binding unless one refers to another qualified Marja\'. The muqallid has two options: follow the precaution, or consult another Marja\' specifically for that issue (tab\'id — partial taqlid). Ihtiyat mustahab means the precaution is recommended but not binding — the muqallid may follow or not.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['ihtiyat','precaution','obligatory','mustahab','taqlid']},
{id:'tq015',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Ihtiyat',marja:'makarem',q:'What does ihtiyat wajib (obligatory precaution) mean?',a:'The concept of ihtiyat shows the scholarly integrity of Maraja\' — when uncertain, they prescribe the safer path rather than issuing potentially wrong definitive rulings. Obligatory precaution is binding unless one refers to another Marja\'. Understanding the difference between fatwa (definitive ruling — must follow), ihtiyat wajib (binding precaution — must follow or refer to another), and ihtiyat mustahab (optional precaution) is essential for every muqallid.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['ihtiyat','precaution','obligatory','mustahab','taqlid']},
{id:'tq016',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Risalah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is a risalah amaliyyah?',a:'The risalah amaliyyah (practical treatise) is the comprehensive book of practical rulings written by a Marja\' for followers. It covers: taharat, salat, sawm, hajj, khums, zakat, trade, marriage, inheritance, and all practical matters. Every muqallid should have and regularly consult their Marja\'s risalah. Sistani\'s main risalahs include: Tawdih al-Masail (in Farsi) and Minhaj al-Salihin (in Arabic). Modern versions are available online and as apps for easy access.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['risalah','practical','book','rulings','guide']},
{id:'tq017',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Risalah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is a risalah amaliyyah?',a:'The risalah is the Marja\'s official compilation of practical rulings. It is organized by subject and covers everything a Muslim needs for daily life. New istifta\'at (questions and answers) supplement the risalah as new issues arise. Every follower should have access to their Marja\'s risalah. In the modern era, websites and apps make this easier than ever — Khamenei.ir provides comprehensive rulings in multiple languages.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['risalah','practical','book','rulings','guide']},
{id:'tq018',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Risalah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is a risalah amaliyyah?',a:'The risalah tradition ensures that every Muslim has access to clear, organized religious guidance. Makarem Shirazi\'s risalah covers traditional topics plus modern issues (medical ethics, banking, technology). The risalah is regularly updated with new istifta\'at addressing contemporary questions. Reading the risalah is itself a form of learning and worship — every Muslim should familiarize themselves with at least the sections relevant to their daily life.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['risalah','practical','book','rulings','guide']},
{id:'tq019',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Ijtihad',marja:'sistani',q:'What is ijtihad and who can practice it?',a:'Ijtihad is the process of deriving Islamic rulings from primary sources (Quran, Sunnah, Ijma, Aql) through rigorous scholarly methodology. A mujtahid must have mastered: Arabic language, Quran sciences, hadith sciences, principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh), rijal (narrator evaluation), logic, and have years of advanced study under qualified scholars. Becoming a mujtahid typically requires 20-30 years of hawza study. Only a qualified mujtahid can issue fatwas.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ijtihad','mujtahid','scholarship','hawza','qualification']},
{id:'tq020',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Ijtihad',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is ijtihad and who can practice it?',a:'Ijtihad is the highest level of Islamic scholarship. It requires comprehensive mastery of multiple disciplines. The process of certification involves senior scholars evaluating the candidate\'s ability to derive independent rulings. The hawza system in Qom and Najaf is the traditional path. Ijtihad is not just academic knowledge but includes spiritual maturity and justice (adalah).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['ijtihad','mujtahid','scholarship','hawza','qualification']},
{id:'tq021',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Ijtihad',marja:'makarem',q:'What is ijtihad and who can practice it?',a:'Ijtihad literally means "exerting maximum effort." It is the engine of Islamic law, allowing it to address new situations while remaining faithful to foundational principles. The mujtahid combines: deep knowledge of classical sources, understanding of contemporary realities, and the ability to apply principles to new situations. This is why Islamic law remains relevant across centuries and cultures.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['ijtihad','mujtahid','scholarship','hawza','qualification']},
{id:'tq022',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Hawza',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the hawza (Islamic seminary) system?',a:'The hawza is the traditional institution of Shia Islamic education. Major centers: Najaf (Iraq), Qom (Iran), with branches worldwide. Curriculum stages: (1) Muqaddimat — foundational Arabic, logic, basic fiqh (3-5 years), (2) Sutuh — intermediate fiqh, usul, and specialized texts (5-7 years), (3) Bahth al-Kharij — advanced research under senior scholars (open-ended, this is where ijtihad is achieved). The hawza has maintained continuous scholarship for over 1000 years.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hawza','seminary','education','najaf','qom']},
{id:'tq023',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Hawza',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the hawza (Islamic seminary) system?',a:'The hawza is the backbone of Shia scholarly tradition. It operates on a unique pedagogical model: students choose their teachers, attend lectures freely, progress at their own pace, and are not bound by formal examinations. This flexibility allows brilliant students to advance quickly while others take more time. The system produces scholars of remarkable depth and breadth.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hawza','seminary','education','najaf','qom']},
{id:'tq024',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Hawza',marja:'noori',q:'What is the hawza (Islamic seminary) system?',a:'The hawza tradition preserved Shia scholarship through centuries of political upheaval. It is characterized by: intellectual freedom, peer-to-peer learning, master-student relationships, communal living, and a culture of debate and dialogue. Modern hawzas are adapting by incorporating technology, broadening curricula, and addressing contemporary challenges while maintaining classical rigor.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['hawza','seminary','education','najaf','qom']},
{id:'tq025',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Precaution',marja:'sistani',q:'What does "obligatory precaution" (ihtiyat wajib) mean?',a:'When a marja says "on the basis of obligatory precaution" (ala al-ahwat al-wujubi), it means the marja has not issued a definitive fatwa but advises following the cautious position. In this case, the muqallid has two options: (1) Follow the precaution, or (2) Refer to the next most knowledgeable marja who has a definitive fatwa on the issue. This is different from "fatwa," which must be followed, and "recommended precaution" (ihtiyat mustahab), which is optional.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ihtiyat','precaution','obligatory','recommended','fatwa']},
{id:'tq026',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Precaution',marja:'khamenei',q:'What does "obligatory precaution" (ihtiyat wajib) mean?',a:'Ihtiyat wajib means the scholar is advising caution without making a binding ruling. The follower can either: act on the precaution (the safer option) or consult another qualified marja who has a clear fatwa. This mechanism shows the scholarly humility of admitting uncertainty on complex issues. Recommended precaution (ihtiyat mustahab) is merely a suggestion with no obligation.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['ihtiyat','precaution','obligatory','recommended','fatwa']},
{id:'tq027',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Precaution',marja:'makarem',q:'What does "obligatory precaution" (ihtiyat wajib) mean?',a:'Understanding the terminology is essential for proper taqlid. The hierarchy: (1) Fatwa — binding ruling, must be followed, (2) Ihtiyat Wajib — obligatory precaution, can follow or refer to another marja, (3) Ihtiyat Mustahab — recommended precaution, purely optional. Many laypeople are confused by these distinctions, leading to unnecessary strictness or laxity.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['ihtiyat','precaution','obligatory','recommended','fatwa']},
{id:'tq028',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Risalah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is a risalah and how should it be used?',a:'A risalah (Tawdih al-Masail or Practical Laws of Islam) is the marja\'s comprehensive book of rulings covering all aspects of daily life. Every muqallid should have access to their marja\'s risalah and consult it regularly. Modern risalahs are available in multiple languages, online, and as apps. The risalah covers: taharat, prayer, fasting, transactions, marriage, and all other fiqhi categories. It is the primary reference for practical rulings.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['risalah','tawdih','book','rulings','reference']},
{id:'tq029',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Risalah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is a risalah and how should it be used?',a:'The risalah is the most important book for a muqallid after the Quran. It should be consulted whenever a new situation arises. Modern digital versions make access easy. Reading the entire risalah at least once is recommended so the muqallid has a general awareness of Islamic rulings. Specific questions can then be looked up as needed.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['risalah','tawdih','book','rulings','reference']},
{id:'tq030',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Risalah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is a risalah and how should it be used?',a:'Think of the risalah as your practical guidebook for Islamic living. It\'s organized by topic and written for laypeople. Every Muslim household should have one. The digital versions (websites, apps) make it even easier to find answers. When the risalah doesn\'t address a specific modern question, you can write to the marja\'s office (istifta) for a direct answer.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['risalah','tawdih','book','rulings','reference']},
{id:'tq031',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Disagreement',marja:'sistani',q:'What if my Marja\'s ruling seems difficult or I disagree?',a:'If a ruling seems difficult, understand that difficulty alone doesn\'t invalidate it — many Islamic obligations require effort. However: (1) Verify you understand the ruling correctly by reading the full context, (2) If it says "ihtiyat wajib," you can refer to another marja, (3) You can write to the marja\'s office for clarification on your specific situation, (4) Personal disagreement based on preference doesn\'t justify ignoring a fatwa — the muqallid follows the marja\'s expertise.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['disagreement','difficulty','hardship','understanding','istifta']},
{id:'tq032',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Disagreement',marja:'makarem',q:'What if my Marja\'s ruling seems difficult or I disagree?',a:'Difficulty in a ruling deserves careful examination. Sometimes the difficulty is based on misunderstanding — the full ruling may have exceptions or alternatives. Contacting the marja\'s office (istifta) with your specific circumstances often reveals that the ruling is more flexible than initially appears. Islam says "God does not burden a soul beyond its capacity" (2:286) — genuine hardship (haraj) can modify rulings.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['disagreement','difficulty','hardship','understanding','istifta']},
{id:'tq033',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Disagreement',marja:'khamenei',q:'What if my Marja\'s ruling seems difficult or I disagree?',a:'A feeling of disagreement should prompt deeper study, not abandonment of taqlid. The scholar has access to sources and methodology that the layperson does not. However, if after genuine study one becomes convinced another marja is more knowledgeable, switching is permissible. The goal is following the most qualified opinion, not the most convenient one.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['disagreement','difficulty','hardship','understanding','istifta']},
{id:'tq034',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Children',marja:'sistani',q:'At what age must children begin following a Marja?',a:'Taqlid becomes obligatory at the age of bulugh (religious maturity): 15 lunar years for boys, 9 lunar years for girls. Before this, children are not obligated but should be gradually taught Islamic practices. Parents should introduce the concept of taqlid and help the child understand their marja\'s rulings. Actions of worship performed before bulugh are valid as tamrini (practice) and earn reward.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['children','bulugh','age','obligation','maturity']},
{id:'tq035',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Children',marja:'khamenei',q:'At what age must children begin following a Marja?',a:'The obligation of taqlid begins at bulugh. Before that, parents have the responsibility to teach Islamic practices according to their own marja\'s rulings. The transition at bulugh should be smooth — the child should already be familiar with prayer, fasting, and basic rulings. Adolescents should be helped to understand why taqlid is important rather than simply being told to follow.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['children','bulugh','age','obligation','maturity']},
{id:'tq036',cat:'taqlid',sub:'Children',marja:'makarem',q:'At what age must children begin following a Marja?',a:'Children reach the age of obligation at bulugh. However, Islamic education should begin much earlier — the Prophet (s) said to command children to pray at age 7. By the time bulugh arrives, the child should have a foundation of knowledge and practice. Choosing a marja at bulugh is an important milestone that parents should guide with care and without coercion.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['children','bulugh','age','obligation','maturity']},
