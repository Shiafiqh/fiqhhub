{id:'in001',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Basic Shares',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the basic inheritance shares in Shia law?',a:'Shia inheritance follows Quranic verses (4:11-12) and ahadith. Key shares: (1) Husband receives 1/4 if wife has children, 1/2 if no children, (2) Wife receives 1/8 if husband has children, 1/4 if no children, (3) One daughter gets 1/2, multiple daughters share 2/3, (4) Father gets 1/6 if deceased has children. The remainder goes to male heirs at double the female share within the same category. This differs from Sunni inheritance in several ways, particularly regarding blocking (hajb) rules.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['inheritance','shares','quran','distribution']},
{id:'in002',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Basic Shares',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the basic inheritance shares in Shia law?',a:'Inheritance distribution is Quranic obligation. The shares (furud) are fixed by divine law. After funeral expenses, debts, and up to 1/3 bequests, the remainder is distributed by Sharia shares. The Shia system prioritizes closer relatives and does not give residual shares to distant relatives when closer ones exist. A will (wasiyyah) can modify up to 1/3 of the estate.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['inheritance','shares','quran','distribution']},
{id:'in003',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Basic Shares',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the basic inheritance shares in Shia law?',a:'The Islamic inheritance system ensures fair distribution among family members. It accounts for different financial responsibilities — men typically bearing maintenance obligations. Key categories of heirs: (1) Parents and children, (2) Grandparents and siblings, (3) Paternal and maternal uncles/aunts. Higher categories exclude lower ones.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['inheritance','shares','quran','distribution']},
{id:'in004',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Women\'s Inheritance',marja:'sistani',q:'Why do women inherit half of what men inherit?',a:'The 2:1 ratio between male and female heirs exists in specific contexts, not universally. A mother can inherit equally with or even more than the father in some scenarios. The ratio relates to men\'s financial obligations: a man must provide nafaqah (maintenance) for his wife, children, and parents, while a woman\'s inheritance is entirely her own with no such obligations. When maintenance responsibilities are factored in, the effective share may actually favor women. Additionally, a woman receives mahr (dowry) at marriage.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['women','inheritance','share','equality','nafaqah']},
{id:'in005',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Women\'s Inheritance',marja:'makarem',q:'Why do women inherit half of what men inherit?',a:'This is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Islamic law. The 2:1 ratio applies between brothers and sisters inheriting from parents, not universally. In many cases women inherit equal or greater shares. The rationale is economic: Islamic law requires men to financially maintain the family, while women\'s wealth remains their own. The system viewed holistically provides economic protection for women.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['women','inheritance','share','equality','nafaqah']},
{id:'in006',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Women\'s Inheritance',marja:'khamenei',q:'Why do women inherit half of what men inherit?',a:'The inheritance shares are divine wisdom. The system must be understood holistically: mahr belongs to the woman, nafaqah is the husband\'s duty, and the wife has no financial obligation toward the household even if wealthy. When all financial rights and obligations are considered together, the system provides comprehensive economic justice for both genders.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['women','inheritance','share','equality','nafaqah']},
{id:'in007',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Will (Wasiyyah)',marja:'sistani',q:'How does a will work in Islamic law?',a:'A Muslim may bequeath up to 1/3 of their estate through a will (wasiyyah) to anyone, including non-heirs, charitable causes, or to supplement a specific heir\'s share. Bequeathing more than 1/3 requires the consent of all heirs after death. The will should be witnessed by two just Muslim men. It is highly recommended to write a will and include provisions for outstanding religious duties (qada prayers, fasts, khums, etc.) to be fulfilled from the estate.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['will','wasiyyah','bequeath','one-third','estate']},
{id:'in008',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Will (Wasiyyah)',marja:'makarem',q:'How does a will work in Islamic law?',a:'A will is strongly recommended for every Muslim. It should include: (1) Declaration of faith, (2) Instructions for funeral and burial, (3) Any outstanding debts or religious obligations, (4) Distribution of the 1/3 bequeathable portion. The will takes effect after funeral expenses and debts. Heirs cannot be bequeathed from this 1/3 unless other heirs consent.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['will','wasiyyah','bequeath','one-third','estate']},
{id:'in009',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Will (Wasiyyah)',marja:'safi',q:'How does a will work in Islamic law?',a:'Writing a will is among the signs of a believer. The Prophet (s) said a Muslim should not sleep without having their will written. It should include debts owed to people and to Allah (unfulfilled prayers, fasts, hajj, khums). The executor (wasi) should be trustworthy and capable of fulfilling the deceased\'s wishes.',source:'Hidayat al-Ibad / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['will','wasiyyah','bequeath','one-third','estate']},
{id:'in010',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Debts',marja:'sistani',q:'How are the deceased person\'s debts handled?',a:'Debts are paid from the estate BEFORE inheritance distribution, in this order: (1) Funeral expenses, (2) Debts to people, (3) Religious debts (khums, zakat, kaffarah), (4) Bequests up to 1/3 of remainder, (5) Inheritance shares. If the estate is insufficient to cover all debts, heirs are NOT obligated to pay from their own wealth. Religious debts (such as unpaid khums or missed prayers/fasts) should be fulfilled from the estate if specified in the will.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['debts','estate','payment','priority','funeral']},
{id:'in011',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Debts',marja:'khamenei',q:'How are the deceased person\'s debts handled?',a:'Debt payment is obligatory from the estate and takes precedence over inheritance. Dying with debts is strongly discouraged — the Prophet (s) initially refused to pray over those who died in debt. Heirs should make every effort to settle debts. If the estate is insufficient, voluntary payment by heirs is highly meritorious but not obligatory.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['debts','estate','payment','priority','funeral']},
{id:'in012',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Non-Muslim Heirs',marja:'sistani',q:'Can non-Muslims inherit from Muslims and vice versa?',a:'A non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim in Islamic law. However, a Muslim CAN inherit from a non-Muslim. If among the heirs some are Muslim and some are non-Muslim, the Muslim heirs receive the inheritance. Some scholars recommend making provisions for non-Muslim family members through the 1/3 bequeathable portion of the will. In non-Muslim countries, civil law may override this, and Muslims should plan accordingly.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['non-muslim','inheritance','convert','religion','will']},
{id:'in013',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Non-Muslim Heirs',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can non-Muslims inherit from Muslims and vice versa?',a:'The principle is that difference in religion blocks inheritance. A Muslim inherits from a non-Muslim relative, but not vice versa. This can be addressed through the wasiyyah (will) by bequeathing up to 1/3 to non-Muslim relatives. In practical terms, Muslims living in non-Muslim countries should create legally binding wills that balance Islamic requirements with local law.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['non-muslim','inheritance','convert','religion','will']},
{id:'in014',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Non-Muslim Heirs',marja:'makarem',q:'Can non-Muslims inherit from Muslims and vice versa?',a:'Religious difference affects inheritance. For Muslim families with non-Muslim members, the will (wasiyyah) provides a practical solution — up to 1/3 can be given to anyone. Muslims should plan their estates carefully, especially in diverse family situations, to ensure both Islamic compliance and fair treatment of all family members.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['non-muslim','inheritance','convert','religion','will']},

{id:'in015',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Adopted Children',marja:'sistani',q:'Do adopted children inherit in Islamic law?',a:'Adopted children do not inherit through the standard Islamic inheritance system, as Islamic law bases inheritance on blood relations and valid marriage. However, the adoptive parents can provide for the child through: (1) Wasiyyah (will) — up to 1/3 of the estate can be bequeathed to anyone, (2) Gifts during lifetime — there is no restriction on giving gifts while alive, (3) Waqf — establishing an endowment for the child\'s benefit. Adoption (kafala) is encouraged in Islam as a form of care, even though it doesn\'t create legal inheritance rights.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['adoption','inheritance','orphan','wasiyyah','gifts']},
{id:'in016',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Adopted Children',marja:'khamenei',q:'Do adopted children inherit in Islamic law?',a:'Islamic adoption (kafala) is caring for a child without changing their lineage. The adopted child keeps their biological family name and does not automatically inherit. However, the system provides for them through bequests and lifetime gifts. The adoptive parents can will up to 1/3 of their estate to the child. Additionally, the adopted child may be given gifts, property, and support during the parents\' lifetime without any restriction. Caring for orphans is among the greatest acts in Islam.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['adoption','inheritance','orphan','wasiyyah','gifts']},
{id:'in017',cat:'inheritance',sub:'Adopted Children',marja:'makarem',q:'Do adopted children inherit in Islamic law?',a:'While adopted children don\'t inherit by default in Islamic law, Islam provides mechanisms to ensure they are cared for: wasiyyah (up to 1/3), lifetime gifts and transfers, establishing educational or living trusts, and making them beneficiaries of waqf. The Prophet (s) said: "I and the one who sponsors an orphan are like these two in Paradise" — holding up two fingers. Islamic society has a collective responsibility toward orphaned and vulnerable children.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['adoption','inheritance','orphan','wasiyyah','gifts']},
