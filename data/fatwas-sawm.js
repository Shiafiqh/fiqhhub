{id:'sw001',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions that make fasting obligatory?',a:'Fasting in Ramadan is obligatory for every Muslim who is: (1) Baligh (has reached the age of religious maturity — 15 lunar years for boys, 9 lunar years for girls). (2) Sane (aqil). (3) Not a traveler (one who must pray qasr). (4) Not ill in a way that fasting would cause harm or significant hardship. (5) Not in the state of hayd (menstruation) or nifas (postnatal bleeding). (6) Not elderly to the extent that fasting causes extreme difficulty (they pay fidyah instead). A pregnant or breastfeeding woman who fears for herself or her child may break her fast.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1559',tags:['conditions','obligatory','ramadan','exemptions']},
{id:'sw002',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'sistani',q:'What things invalidate the fast?',a:'The following invalidate the fast: (1) Eating and drinking intentionally — even small amounts. (2) Sexual intercourse. (3) Masturbation leading to ejaculation. (4) Attributing lies to Allah, the Prophet (s), or the Imams (as) — as an obligatory precaution. (5) Allowing thick dust or smoke to reach the throat intentionally. (6) Immersing the entire head in water — according to obligatory precaution. (7) Remaining in the state of janabah until Fajr intentionally. (8) Intentional vomiting. (9) Using a liquid enema. If any of these are done intentionally, the fast is broken. If done forgetfully, the fast remains valid.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1573',tags:['invalidators','breaking','fast','intentional']},
{id:'sw003',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'sistani',q:'Does using an asthma inhaler break the fast?',a:'Using an asthma inhaler that delivers medication in spray/mist form does not break the fast, because the spray is medicine that goes to the lungs, not food or drink that enters the stomach. This is the ruling as an obligatory precaution — the inhaler is more akin to breathing medicated air than to eating or drinking. However, if the inhaler delivers a significant liquid that can be tasted and enters the throat as a liquid, then as a precaution, one should avoid it while fasting unless medically necessary, in which case health takes priority.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['inhaler','asthma','medicine','fast','breaking']},
{id:'sw004',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does receiving an injection break the fast?',a:'Injections — whether intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous — do not break the fast. This includes insulin injections, vitamin injections, vaccinations, and medical IV drips. The criterion for breaking the fast is eating and drinking through the normal channel (mouth/throat to stomach). Injections bypass this channel entirely. Similarly, blood tests (drawing blood) do not break the fast, though it is better to avoid them if it causes weakness that makes fasting difficult.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['injection','IV','insulin','fast','medical']},
{id:'sw005',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'makarem',q:'Does swallowing saliva break the fast?',a:'Swallowing one\'s own normal saliva does not break the fast, even in large amounts. This is because saliva is naturally produced in the mouth and its swallowing is unavoidable. However, if saliva has been mixed with something external (like food remnants stuck between teeth), swallowing it intentionally breaks the fast. If one gathers saliva in the mouth deliberately and swallows it, it still does not break the fast as long as it is pure saliva. Mucus that comes from the head to the mouth and throat, if swallowed before entering the mouth cavity, does not break the fast.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['saliva','swallowing','fast','validity']},
{id:'sw006',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'sistani',q:'Does brushing teeth break the fast?',a:'Brushing teeth with a toothbrush does not break the fast as long as the person does not swallow water or toothpaste. One should be careful to spit out all water and toothpaste residue. It is better to brush before Fajr, but brushing during the day is permissible with caution. Using miswak (a natural tooth-cleaning stick) is also permissible and even recommended. If a small amount of water goes down the throat unintentionally while being careful, the fast is not broken.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['brushing','teeth','toothpaste','fast']},
{id:'sw007',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does smoking or vaping break the fast?',a:'As an obligatory precaution, smoking breaks the fast. Smoke that is intentionally inhaled and reaches the throat constitutes introducing something into the body through the normal oral channel. This applies to cigarettes, shisha/hookah, and vaping/e-cigarettes. The nicotine vapor from e-cigarettes is also considered to break the fast as an obligatory precaution. Beyond the fasting issue, smoking is either haram or strongly disliked (depending on the extent of health harm) due to the established medical evidence of its harmful effects.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['smoking','vaping','cigarettes','fast','haram']},
{id:'sw008',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'sistani',q:'Do eye drops or ear drops break the fast?',a:'Eye drops do not break the fast even if one can taste them in the throat afterward. The eyes are not a normal channel for eating and drinking. Ear drops also do not break the fast if the eardrum is intact. However, if the eardrum is perforated and ear drops reach the throat through the opening, it is a precaution to avoid them while fasting. Nose drops that are absorbed through the nasal membrane and do not reach the throat do not break the fast, but if they flow down into the throat, they break the fast as a precaution.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['eye drops','ear drops','nose drops','fast']},
{id:'sw009',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'makarem',q:'Does a blood test break the fast?',a:'No, having blood drawn for medical tests does not break the fast. The invalidators of fasting are specific acts related to introducing things into the body through the oral/throat channel. Removing blood from the body does not fall under any category of fast-breaking acts. However, if the blood loss causes significant weakness that makes continuing the fast harmful, the person may have a medical excuse to break the fast for health reasons.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['blood test','drawing blood','fast','medical']},
{id:'sw010',cat:'sawm',sub:'Kaffarah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the kaffarah (expiation) for deliberately breaking the fast?',a:'If a person deliberately breaks their Ramadan fast without valid excuse, the kaffarah is one of the following: (1) Freeing a slave (no longer applicable). (2) Fasting for 60 consecutive days — of which at least 31 must be consecutive; after 31, the remaining can be non-consecutive if there is a valid excuse for interruption. (3) Feeding 60 poor people — each person receiving approximately 750 grams of food (wheat, rice, bread, etc.). If the fast was broken by a haram act (like eating something haram or drinking alcohol), some scholars require all three (jam\' — combination), but as an obligatory precaution, feeding 60 poor is sufficient.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1660',tags:['kaffarah','expiation','deliberate','breaking','penalty']},
{id:'sw011',cat:'sawm',sub:'Kaffarah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What if someone cannot perform any of the kaffarah options?',a:'If a person is genuinely unable to perform any of the kaffarah options (cannot fast 60 days due to health, and cannot afford to feed 60 poor people), they should seek forgiveness from Allah (istighfar) sincerely and give whatever charity they can afford. The obligation of kaffarah does not lapse — if their circumstances change later and they become able to perform it, they should do so. But in the interim, sincere repentance and whatever charity one can manage is accepted.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['kaffarah','inability','poverty','forgiveness','charity']},
{id:'sw012',cat:'sawm',sub:'Fidyah',marja:'sistani',q:'Who must pay fidyah instead of fasting?',a:'Fidyah (compensation) instead of fasting applies to: (1) Elderly persons for whom fasting causes extreme difficulty — they pay fidyah and do not need to make up the fast. (2) Persons with chronic illness that prevents fasting — same ruling. (3) Pregnant women near delivery who fear for themselves or the child — they pay fidyah AND must make up the fast later. (4) Breastfeeding women with insufficient milk if fasting would harm the child — same as pregnant women. The fidyah for each day is feeding one poor person with approximately 750 grams of staple food (wheat, rice, etc.) or its monetary equivalent.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1725',tags:['fidyah','elderly','illness','pregnant','compensation']},
{id:'sw013',cat:'sawm',sub:'Recommended',marja:'sistani',q:'What are some recommended fasts throughout the year?',a:'Recommended fasts include: (1) First and last Thursday of each month and the first Wednesday after the 10th. (2) 13th, 14th, and 15th of each lunar month (Ayyam al-Bidh). (3) The entire months of Rajab and Sha\'ban. (4) The day of Eid al-Ghadir (18th Dhul Hijjah). (5) The day of Mab\'ath (27th Rajab). (6) 1st to 9th Dhul Hijjah. (7) Nawruz day. However, fasting on the two Eid days (Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha) is haram. Fasting on the day of Ashura (10th Muharram) should be with the intention of mourning/sadness, not celebration.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['recommended','mustahab','special days','yearly']},
{id:'sw014',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'sistani',q:'Does unintentional eating (forgetting one is fasting) break the fast?',a:'No, if a person eats or drinks out of forgetfulness while fasting, their fast is not broken. They should stop eating immediately upon remembering and continue their fast. No kaffarah or qada is required. This is based on the principle that acts done out of forgetfulness are pardoned. However, if someone reminds them that they are fasting, they must stop immediately. If they continue eating after being reminded or after remembering, the fast is broken.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1575',tags:['forgetfulness','eating','unintentional','fast','valid']},
{id:'sw015',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'shirazi',q:'Does intentional vomiting break the fast?',a:'Yes, intentional vomiting breaks the fast and requires qada. If vomiting occurs involuntarily (without the person deliberately inducing it), the fast is not broken. However, if the person could prevent the vomit from exiting but chose not to, it is treated as intentional. After involuntary vomiting, if some vomit returns to the throat and the person swallows it deliberately, the fast is broken. One should spit out any residue and rinse the mouth.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['vomiting','intentional','involuntary','fast','breaking']},
{id:'sw016',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'khamenei',q:'At what age does fasting become obligatory for girls and boys?',a:'Fasting becomes obligatory for boys at 15 lunar years of age (approximately 14 years and 7 months in the solar calendar) and for girls at 9 lunar years of age (approximately 8 years and 9 months in the solar calendar). Before this age, fasting is not obligatory but is encouraged for practice and training. Parents should encourage children to fast, even partial days, to build the habit. The lunar age calculation means the exact solar age varies — one should calculate precisely using the lunar calendar.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['age','boys','girls','bulugh','maturity']},
{id:'sw017',cat:'sawm',sub:'Traveler',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a traveler fast voluntarily during Ramadan?',a:'No, a person who is traveling (and whose prayer is qasr) cannot fast during Ramadan — the fast is not valid for them. They must break their fast and make it up (qada) after Ramadan. This is not optional; fasting while traveling is invalid according to Shia jurisprudence, based on clear narrations from the Imams (as). However, if the traveler reaches their destination and intends to stay 10 days before noon and has not eaten anything, they can make the intention to fast for that day.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1717',tags:['travel','fasting','invalid','qasr','ramadan']},
{id:'sw018',cat:'sawm',sub:'Sighting',marja:'sistani',q:'How is the beginning of Ramadan determined?',a:'The beginning of Ramadan is determined by sighting the new crescent moon (hilal) of Ramadan. This can be established by: (1) Personal sighting of the moon. (2) Testimony of two just (adil) witnesses. (3) The passage of 30 days from the previous month (Sha\'ban). (4) A ruling (hukm) from a qualified Marja or his authorized representative. (5) Widespread public knowledge (tawatur) that the moon has been sighted. Astronomical calculations alone, without actual sighting, are not sufficient according to obligatory precaution. The moon must be visible to the naked eye in one\'s horizon.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1738',tags:['moon','sighting','hilal','ramadan','beginning']},
{id:'sw019',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'makarem',q:'Can a person with diabetes fast during Ramadan?',a:'A person with diabetes should consult their doctor. If fasting would cause medically significant harm — such as dangerous drops in blood sugar, diabetic complications, or risk to vital organs — they are exempt from fasting and should pay fidyah (for chronic conditions) or make up the fast when possible (for temporary conditions). If the doctor confirms fasting is safe with medication adjustment and monitoring, then fasting is obligatory. The person\'s own informed assessment of harm, guided by medical advice, is the determining factor.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['diabetes','medical','exemption','harm','fasting']},
{id:'sw020',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'sistani',q:'Does swimming break the fast?',a:'As an obligatory precaution, submerging the entire head under water breaks the fast. Therefore, swimming underwater where the head is fully submerged should be avoided while fasting. However, swimming in a manner where the head remains above water (such as doing breaststroke with the face up) does not break the fast. Showering, even if water flows over the head, does not break the fast because the head is not submerged in water. Diving and underwater swimming should be avoided during fasting.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1617',tags:['swimming','submerging','head','water','fast']},
{id:'sw021',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'najafi',q:'Can one use a nicotine patch while fasting?',a:'A nicotine patch applied to the skin does not break the fast. The patch delivers nicotine through the skin, not through the oral/throat channel, which is the pathway relevant to fast-breaking. The same applies to any transdermal medication — patches, topical creams, and ointments do not affect the validity of the fast regardless of the medication they deliver.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['nicotine patch','medication','skin','fast']},
{id:'sw022',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'sistani',q:'Does a gastroscopy or endoscopy break the fast?',a:'If a medical instrument (like a gastroscope) is inserted through the mouth into the stomach, it breaks the fast if any liquid or substance enters the throat/stomach along with it (such as lubricant or the scope itself which occupies the throat). As a precaution, a gastroscopy performed during fasting hours would invalidate the fast. If possible, such procedures should be scheduled outside of fasting hours. If medically necessary during fasting hours, the person\'s health takes priority and they make up the fast afterward.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['endoscopy','gastroscopy','medical','fast','procedure']},
{id:'sw023',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'makarem',q:'Does sexual arousal without ejaculation break the fast?',a:'Sexual arousal without ejaculation does not break the fast. Merely experiencing sexual thoughts, arousal, or involuntary physical responses without deliberately causing ejaculation does not invalidate the fast. However, if a person deliberately engages in acts that they know will lead to ejaculation (such as deliberate stimulation), and ejaculation occurs, then the fast is broken and both qada and kaffarah become obligatory. Wet dreams (involuntary ejaculation during sleep) do not break the fast.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['arousal','ejaculation','sexual','fast','wet dream']},
{id:'sw024',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the exact time for suhoor (pre-dawn meal) and iftar (breaking fast)?',a:'Suhoor must be completed before the Fajr adhan (the true dawn — when a horizontal line of light appears on the eastern horizon). Eating must stop at this point. If uncertain, one should stop earlier as a precaution. Iftar (breaking the fast) is at Maghrib — which is when the redness in the eastern sky (that appears after sunset) passes overhead. As an obligatory precaution, one should wait until this redness passes rather than breaking the fast exactly at sunset. In practice, this is typically a few minutes after the sun drops below the horizon.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1559',tags:['suhoor','iftar','time','fajr','maghrib','fasting']},
{id:'sw025',cat:'sawm',sub:'Recommended',marja:'hamedani',q:'What is I\'tikaf and when is it recommended?',a:'I\'tikaf is the practice of spiritual retreat in a mosque for a minimum of three days, with fasting each day. It is highly recommended, particularly in the last ten days of Ramadan. The conditions for I\'tikaf are: (1) It must be at least three consecutive days. (2) Must be performed while fasting. (3) Must be in a major congregational mosque (jami\'). (4) The person must remain in the mosque, only leaving for necessities (bathroom, emergency). (5) Must have the permission of anyone whose rights might be affected (spouse, parents, employer). I\'tikaf is one of the most spiritually rewarding voluntary acts of worship.',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah',tags:['itikaf','retreat','mosque','ramadan','spiritual']},
{id:'sw026',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'sistani',q:'Does using perfume or cologne break the fast?',a:'Using perfume, cologne, or other fragrances does not break the fast. Smelling pleasant scents is not among the invalidators of fasting. However, some scholars have said it is better (recommended precaution) to avoid inhaling very thick or intense incense smoke that fills the nasal passages, as very thick smoke intentionally inhaled may be covered under the invalidator of "allowing thick dust to reach the throat." Normal perfume application and incidental fragrance do not affect the fast.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['perfume','cologne','fragrance','fast']},
{id:'sw027',cat:'sawm',sub:'Qada',marja:'sistani',q:'Is there a deadline for making up missed Ramadan fasts?',a:'Missed Ramadan fasts should be made up before the next Ramadan arrives. If a person deliberately delays their qada until the next Ramadan without valid excuse, they must both make up the fast AND pay a fidyah (feeding one poor person per day). If the delay was due to a valid excuse (continued illness, travel), only the qada is required with no fidyah. There is no limit to how long the qada obligation remains — it does not expire. Even if years pass, the person must still make up the fasts.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 1707',tags:['qada','deadline','makeup','delay','fidyah']},
{id:'sw028',cat:'sawm',sub:'Medical',marja:'wahid',q:'Does using a suppository break the fast?',a:'Using a suppository (rectal medication) does not break the fast according to the stronger opinion. The invalidator mentioned in narrations regarding enemas specifically refers to liquid enemas that serve a nutritive function. Medical suppositories that are inserted for treatment purposes do not fall under the same category. However, as a recommended precaution, it is better to use them outside fasting hours when possible.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['suppository','medication','rectal','fast']},
{id:'sw029',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to fast on behalf of a deceased person?',a:'Yes, it is permissible and meritorious to fast on behalf of a deceased Muslim. This can be done as a voluntary act of charity for the deceased. For obligatory fasts that the deceased missed, the eldest son has a particular obligation to make them up (or hire someone to do so). Any Muslim can also fast on behalf of the deceased as a gift of reward (thawab). The intention should specify that the fast is being performed on behalf of the named deceased person.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['deceased','behalf','qada','merit','gift']},
{id:'sw030',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'sistani',q:'What if food stuck between teeth is swallowed during fasting?',a:'If food particles that were stuck between the teeth are swallowed unintentionally, the fast is not broken. However, if a person knows there is food between their teeth and deliberately swallows it, the fast is broken. It is recommended to clean the teeth (brush or floss) before the fast begins to remove any food remnants. If food comes out from between the teeth into the mouth, the person should spit it out and not swallow it.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['food','teeth','swallowing','unintentional','fast']},
{id:'sw031',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'Who is exempt from fasting?',a:'Exemptions from fasting in Ramadan: (1) Children who have not reached bulugh (puberty), (2) The insane, (3) The sick for whom fasting would cause harm — they make up later, (4) Travelers meeting the travel conditions — they make up later, (5) The elderly who cannot fast — they pay fidyah (feeding one poor person per day), (6) Pregnant women near delivery if fasting harms them or the baby — pay fidyah and make up later, (7) Breastfeeding women if fasting reduces milk and harms the child — pay fidyah and make up, (8) Women in haydh or nifas — make up later without fidyah.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['fasting','exemption','ramadan','elderly','pregnant','sick']},
{id:'sw032',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who is exempt from fasting?',a:'Islam exempts from fasting those for whom it would cause genuine hardship: the ill, travelers, elderly, pregnant and nursing women (when there is harm). These exemptions show divine mercy. Important: the elderly who cannot fast at all pay fidyah (approximately 750g of food staple per day) and do not need to make up the fasts. Those with temporary illness must make up after recovery. Diabetics and those with chronic conditions should consult both their doctor and their marja.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['fasting','exemption','ramadan','elderly','pregnant','sick']},
{id:'sw033',cat:'sawm',sub:'Conditions',marja:'makarem',q:'Who is exempt from fasting?',a:'The exemptions are compassionate. Key modern scenarios: (1) A person with diabetes — consult your doctor; if fasting is medically dangerous, you are exempt. (2) A pregnant woman — if your doctor says fasting may harm the pregnancy, you are exempt and should not fast. (3) A student with exams during Ramadan — this alone is NOT an exemption; only genuine medical inability qualifies. (4) Physical laborers — if fasting causes dangerous dehydration/exhaustion, they may be exempt but should try to find alternative arrangements.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['fasting','exemption','ramadan','elderly','pregnant','sick']},
{id:'sw034',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'sistani',q:'What actions invalidate the fast?',a:'The fast is invalidated by: (1) Eating or drinking intentionally, (2) Sexual intercourse, (3) Masturbation leading to ejaculation, (4) Deliberately causing thick dust to reach the throat, (5) Submerging the entire head in water (on obligatory precaution), (6) Remaining in the state of janabah until fajr deliberately, (7) Vomiting intentionally, (8) Liquid enema. Importantly: swallowing saliva, involuntary vomiting, using eye drops, ear drops, injections (non-nutritional), blood tests, and inhaler use for asthma do NOT invalidate the fast.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['fasting','invalidators','eating','drinking','muftirat']},
{id:'sw035',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'khamenei',q:'What actions invalidate the fast?',a:'Invalidators include eating, drinking, sexual relations, deliberate vomiting, and remaining intentionally in janabah until fajr. Modern clarifications: (1) IV drips with nutritional content invalidate the fast; saline drips are debated. (2) Asthma inhalers do NOT break the fast as the medication goes to the lungs, not the stomach. (3) Blood tests do not break the fast. (4) Swallowing phlegm that reaches the mouth does not break the fast according to the stronger opinion. (5) Smoking breaks the fast.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['fasting','invalidators','eating','drinking','muftirat']},

DOES NOT break the fast: brushing teeth (don\'t swallow water), eye/ear drops, injections (non-nutritional), blood donation, asthma inhaler, swallowing saliva, involuntary vomiting, tasting food without swallowing (for cooking — though best avoided), unintentional swallowing of water during ghusl.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['fasting','invalidators','eating','drinking','muftirat']},
{id:'sw037',cat:'sawm',sub:'Invalidators',marja:'shirazi',q:'What actions invalidate the fast?',a:'The eight muftirat (invalidators) are established through Quran and Sunnah. The general principle is that deliberately introducing something into the body through the mouth/nose invalidates the fast. What enters through other routes (injections, eye drops, ear drops) is debated, with the stronger contemporary opinion being that it does not invalidate. If one accidentally eats or drinks (genuinely forgetting they are fasting), the fast remains valid — this is a mercy from Allah.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['fasting','invalidators','eating','drinking','muftirat']},
{id:'sw038',cat:'sawm',sub:'Kaffarah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the kaffarah for deliberately breaking a fast in Ramadan?',a:'For deliberately breaking a Ramadan fast without valid excuse, the kaffarah is: (1) Freeing a slave (not applicable today), (2) Fasting for 60 consecutive days (if 1 is not possible), (3) Feeding 60 poor people (if 2 is not possible). For breaking the fast with something haram (like alcohol), on obligatory precaution, one must do ALL three (called jam\' — combination kaffarah). Additionally, the missed day must be made up (qada). Deliberate means with full knowledge and intention — genuine forgetfulness has no kaffarah.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['kaffarah','ramadan','deliberate','fasting','penalty','sixty']},

If breaking with a haram substance, the stronger precaution requires combining: both fasting 60 days AND feeding 60 poor people. The severity of kaffarah reflects the sanctity of Ramadan fasting.

Practically: feeding 60 poor people can be done through Islamic charities that accept kaffarah payments. The amount per person is approximately 750g of wheat/rice/bread or its monetary equivalent. For the 60-day fasting option: you must fast 31 consecutive days, then can complete the remaining 29 at any pace.

They must make up the missed days later. If the traveler arrives at their home or place of intended 10-day stay before dhuhr (noon) without having done anything that breaks the fast, they should make the intention and fast that day.

This is not optional; it is a definite ruling. If someone deliberately fasts while meeting travel conditions, the fast is void. The conditions mirror those for shortening prayer: 44+ km distance, not a professional traveler, etc. For frequent travelers: plan your Ramadan schedule to minimize travel days, and make up missed days promptly after Ramadan.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['travel','fasting','ramadan','qasr','invalid']},
{id:'sw043',cat:'sawm',sub:'Travel',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on fasting while traveling?',a:'The travel fasting rule is clear: if you qualify for shortened prayer, you cannot fast. Common modern scenarios: (1) You commute 50km daily to work — if you\'re considered a professional traveler (pray full), you also fast normally. (2) Business trip during Ramadan — don\'t fast during travel days, make them up later. (3) You leave your city after noon already fasting — complete that day\'s fast.

(3) Eid prayer is recommended during the occultation (some say wajib). (4) It is mustahab to: eat before Eid prayer (preferably dates), do ghusl, wear best clothes, apply perfume, walk to the prayer ground, give charity generously.

The amount varies by marja but is typically 3 kg of staple food or equivalent cash. Priority recipients: the poor in your community. Eid prayer is 2 rak\'ahs with extra takbirat and qunut in each rak\'ah.

Rules: (1) It must be in a congregational mosque (masjid jami\'). (2) One must fast during i\'tikaf (so it can only occur during Ramadan or when one can fast). (3) One cannot leave the mosque except for necessities (bathroom, ghusl, emergency). (4) After 2 days, the 3rd day becomes obligatory to complete. (5) Sexual relations, arguing, buying/selling, and smelling fragrance with pleasure are prohibited during i\'tikaf.
