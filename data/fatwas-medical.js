{id:'md001',cat:'medical',sub:'Treatment',marja:'sistani',q:'Is it permissible for a male doctor to treat a female patient?',a:'A male doctor may treat a female patient when: (1) A female doctor is not available or the male doctor is more specialized for the condition. (2) The examination is limited to what is medically necessary. (3) Looking at and touching the body should be limited to the area required for diagnosis and treatment. (4) If possible, the examination should be done over clothing or using instruments that minimize direct contact. (5) A mahram or female nurse should be present if possible. The principle of necessity (darura) allows what is normally prohibited. The reverse also applies — a female doctor may treat male patients under similar conditions. Medical necessity overrides gender-separation rules.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2',tags:['doctor','female','male','treatment','necessity']},
{id:'md002',cat:'medical',sub:'Abortion',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on abortion?',a:'Abortion is generally haram in Islam after the soul is breathed into the fetus (ensoulment), which occurs at 4 months (120 days) according to most scholars. Before ensoulment: abortion is still haram as a precaution, but some scholars permit it under specific circumstances such as: severe threat to the mother\'s life, severe genetic abnormalities incompatible with life, or extreme hardship. After ensoulment: abortion is haram and equivalent to killing a human being, except when the mother\'s life is in definite danger and there is no other way to save her. The diyah (blood money) varies based on the stage of pregnancy. Each case should be individually assessed by a scholar.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['abortion','haram','ensoulment','life','mother']},
{id:'md003',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is euthanasia or assisted suicide permissible?',a:'Active euthanasia (intentionally ending a patient\'s life, even at their request) is absolutely haram and constitutes murder. Assisted suicide is similarly prohibited. Life belongs to Allah, and humans do not have the right to end it. However, withdrawing futile treatment in hopeless cases is a separate discussion: if medical professionals determine that treatment is no longer beneficial and is merely prolonging the dying process, withdrawing such treatment may be permissible — this is not euthanasia but allowing the natural process to occur. Pain management that may hasten death as an unintended side effect (double effect) is also a nuanced discussion, generally permissible when the intent is pain relief.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['euthanasia','suicide','haram','life','treatment']},
{id:'md004',cat:'medical',sub:'Organ Donation',marja:'makarem',q:'Is organ donation permissible in Islam?',a:'Organ donation is permissible and even praiseworthy under these conditions: (1) From a living donor: permissible if it does not cause significant harm to the donor (e.g., donating one kidney when the other is healthy). (2) After death: donating organs to save lives is permissible, especially if the person willed it before death or the family consents. Saving a human life is one of the highest Islamic values. (3) Selling organs is more controversial — some scholars prohibit it while others permit it under regulated conditions. (4) The organs should go to a person in genuine need. (5) Brain-death criteria and determination of death must follow reliable medical standards. This is one of the areas where contemporary scholars have been relatively progressive.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['organ donation','transplant','permissible','life','death']},
{id:'md005',cat:'medical',sub:'IVF',marja:'sistani',q:'Is in-vitro fertilization (IVF) permissible?',a:'IVF is permissible when: (1) The egg and sperm are from the married couple themselves (husband and wife). (2) The fertilized embryo is implanted in the wife\'s womb. Using donor sperm or donor eggs from outside the marriage is prohibited according to most Shia scholars. However, some scholars discuss whether using a donor egg with the husband\'s sperm when the wife cannot produce eggs might be permissible under certain conditions — this is highly debated. Surrogacy (implanting the couple\'s embryo in another woman\'s womb) is also debated, with many scholars cautioning against it due to lineage complications. The child from permissible IVF belongs to both parents.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['IVF','fertility','permissible','embryo','donor']},
{id:'md006',cat:'medical',sub:'Contraception',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is contraception (birth control) permissible?',a:'Contraception is generally permissible with the wife\'s consent: (1) Temporary methods (condoms, pills, IUDs, withdrawal/azl) are all permissible. Some narrations indicate azl should have the wife\'s consent. (2) Permanent sterilization (vasectomy, tubal ligation) is permissible if there is a legitimate reason, though scholars recommend against it without medical necessity since it eliminates the possibility of future children. (3) The wife may use contraception independently if her health or circumstances warrant it. (4) Contraception should not be used to avoid having children entirely — the Islamic ethos encourages procreation, but family planning within marriage is acceptable and reasonable.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['contraception','birth control','permissible','methods','sterilization']},
{id:'md007',cat:'medical',sub:'Gender',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic ruling on gender reassignment?',a:'Gender reassignment surgery for individuals with genuine gender dysphoria (where a person\'s psychological gender identity differs from their biological sex) is permissible according to several Shia scholars, including Imam Khomeini who issued a fatwa permitting it. The conditions are: (1) Genuine medical diagnosis by qualified professionals. (2) Other treatments have been ineffective. (3) The surgery is expected to relieve the psychological distress. After the surgery, the person assumes all legal rulings of their reassigned gender regarding marriage, inheritance, hijab, etc. This is based on the principle that medical treatment to align body and mind is permissible. Iran has been notable for recognizing this ruling.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['gender','transgender','surgery','permissible','reassignment']},
{id:'md008',cat:'medical',sub:'Autopsy',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is autopsy permissible in Islam?',a:'Autopsy (dissection of a deceased body) is generally not permissible because of the Islamic obligation to respect the deceased body. However, it is permitted when: (1) Required by law for criminal investigations (determining cause of death in suspected murder/foul play). (2) Necessary to identify communicable diseases that threaten public health. (3) Required for medical/legal purposes that serve a significant public interest. (4) The deceased or their family consented for medical education when there is genuine need for Islamic society. If autopsy is performed, it should be limited to what is necessary and the body should be treated with respect and properly prepared for burial afterwards. Diyah may be owed for unnecessary mutilation.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['autopsy','deceased','permissible','necessity','respect']},
{id:'md009',cat:'medical',sub:'Fasting',marja:'makarem',q:'Should a patient with diabetes fast in Ramadan?',a:'A diabetic patient should consult their doctor. If fasting poses a significant risk to health (dangerous blood sugar drops/spikes, risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, potential organ damage), fasting is not obligatory and may be haram (since self-harm is prohibited). Type 1 diabetics who require insulin may be exempted. Type 2 diabetics on oral medications — the situation varies by individual. If the doctor advises against fasting, the patient should not fast and instead pay fidyah (feeding one poor person per day). If the condition is chronic and permanent, only fidyah is required. If temporary, qada is also required when health permits. The person\'s life and health take priority over fasting.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['diabetes','fasting','exemption','health','fidyah']},
{id:'md010',cat:'medical',sub:'Cosmetic Surgery',marja:'wahid',q:'Is cosmetic surgery permissible?',a:'Cosmetic surgery is permissible in principle if it does not involve significant health risks and the purpose is to correct a genuine defect or abnormality that causes distress (e.g., repairing a cleft lip, burns reconstruction, nose correction for breathing or appearance). Elective cosmetic surgery purely for beautification (breast augmentation, liposuction, facelifts) is also technically permissible according to many scholars, as there is no specific prohibition against improving one\'s appearance. However: (1) Gender interaction rules during surgery must be considered. (2) It should not be driven by unhealthy vanity or self-harm. (3) It should not involve deception before marriage. (4) Health risks must be minimized.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['cosmetic','surgery','permissible','beautification','defect']},
{id:'md011',cat:'medical',sub:'Gender in Medicine',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a male doctor treat a female patient and vice versa?',a:'A person should seek medical treatment from a practitioner of the same gender when possible. However, if a same-gender doctor is unavailable, or the opposite-gender doctor is more qualified for the specific condition, it is permissible for cross-gender medical treatment. Medical necessity overrides the normal modesty rules. The doctor should examine only what is necessary and maintain professionalism. Emergency situations have no gender restriction at all — saving life takes absolute priority.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['medical','gender','doctor','examination','modesty','treatment']},
{id:'md012',cat:'medical',sub:'Gender in Medicine',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can a male doctor treat a female patient and vice versa?',a:'Medical treatment by an opposite-gender doctor is permitted when: (1) No same-gender doctor is available, (2) The same-gender doctor is less qualified for the condition, (3) Emergency situations. The examination should be limited to medical necessity. In modern hospitals with professional standards, cross-gender treatment is routine and acceptable. The Islamic concern is protecting modesty — modern medical settings generally achieve this through professional protocols, chaperones, and draping.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['medical','gender','doctor','examination','modesty','treatment']},
{id:'md013',cat:'medical',sub:'Gender in Medicine',marja:'makarem',q:'Can a male doctor treat a female patient and vice versa?',a:'The priority is: same-gender doctor when available and equally qualified. When a cross-gender doctor is needed: it is permissible. Key points: (1) Emergency — absolutely no restrictions, save the life first, (2) Obstetrics — female OB/GYN is preferred but a male is fully permitted when necessary, (3) Surgery — the best surgeon should operate regardless of gender, (4) Mental health — the therapist one is most comfortable with is the right choice. Health takes priority over gender considerations.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['medical','gender','doctor','examination','modesty','treatment']},
{id:'md014',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on euthanasia?',a:'Active euthanasia (deliberately ending a patient\'s life) is haram — it constitutes murder regardless of the patient\'s condition or request. Life is sacred and belongs to Allah. However: (1) Withdrawing futile treatment that only prolongs dying (not living) is a separate discussion — many scholars permit this. (2) Not initiating extraordinary measures for a terminal patient is different from killing. (3) Palliative care that may incidentally shorten life (pain management) is permissible if the intention is comfort, not death. (4) A living will requesting no extraordinary measures may be respected.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['euthanasia','death','medical','life','haram','palliative']},
{id:'md015',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on euthanasia?',a:'Euthanasia is prohibited in Islam — no person has the right to take their own life or authorize others to do so. "Do not kill yourselves — indeed Allah is Merciful to you" (4:29). However, there is a distinction between: (a) actively killing a patient (haram), (b) withdrawing treatments that only prolong suffering without hope of recovery (permissible in many scholars\' views), (c) providing pain relief that may hasten death as a side effect (permissible with proper intention). Suffering should be alleviated through all halal means.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['euthanasia','death','medical','life','haram','palliative']},
{id:'md016',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on euthanasia?',a:'The sanctity of life is a core Islamic value. Active euthanasia (lethal injection, overdose) is haram regardless of circumstances. However, Islam is also compassionate about suffering. The nuanced position: (1) Extraordinary measures need not be initiated if they only prolong dying, (2) A patient or family can choose comfort care over aggressive treatment, (3) Pain management is a right even if it inadvertently shortens life, (4) A brain-dead patient can have life support withdrawn. The goal is neither hastening death nor unnecessarily prolonging suffering.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['euthanasia','death','medical','life','haram','palliative']},
{id:'md017',cat:'medical',sub:'Contraception',marja:'sistani',q:'Is contraception permissible in Islam?',a:'Contraception is generally permissible if both spouses agree. Methods: (1) Condoms — halal, (2) Birth control pills — halal, (3) IUD — halal (the older concern about it causing abortion is addressed by modern medical understanding that it prevents fertilization), (4) Natural methods — halal, (5) Withdrawal (azl) — halal with wife\'s consent. Permanent sterilization (vasectomy, tubal ligation) is permissible if there is a valid reason and it doesn\'t cause additional harm. The wife\'s consent is important for any method.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['contraception','family planning','halal','birth control','permissible']},
{id:'md018',cat:'medical',sub:'Contraception',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is contraception permissible in Islam?',a:'Family planning through contraception is permissible. Islam encourages having children but does not prohibit spacing births or limiting family size for valid reasons (health, financial, educational considerations). Both temporary and permanent contraception methods are halal. The Prophet (s) permitted azl (withdrawal), which demonstrates the permissibility of preventing conception. The wife\'s right to contraception is recognized — she should not be forced to have children against her health or wishes.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['contraception','family planning','halal','birth control','permissible']},
{id:'md019',cat:'medical',sub:'Contraception',marja:'makarem',q:'Is contraception permissible in Islam?',a:'Contraception is halal with mutual spousal agreement. Islam values children ("Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world" — 18:46) but also values quality of upbringing and the health of the mother. Choosing to space children or limit family size for legitimate reasons is not against Islamic values. All modern contraceptive methods are permissible: hormonal, barrier, surgical. Only abortion after ensoulment (120 days) as a contraceptive method is haram.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['contraception','family planning','halal','birth control','permissible']},
{id:'md020',cat:'medical',sub:'Abortion',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on abortion?',a:'Abortion is categorized by stage: (1) Before ensoulment (before 4 months/120 days): haram according to obligatory precaution, but some scholars permit it for valid reasons (severe fetal abnormality, serious threat to mother\'s life, extreme hardship). Diyah (blood money) must be paid. (2) After ensoulment (after 4 months): absolutely haram except when the mother\'s life is in definite danger — in that case, saving the mother takes priority. The diyah after ensoulment is full blood money. (3) At any stage: if the mother\'s life is at immediate risk, saving her is obligatory.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['abortion','haram','ensoulment','mother','life','medical']},
{id:'md021',cat:'medical',sub:'Abortion',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on abortion?',a:'Abortion is generally forbidden at all stages. Before ensoulment, it is haram but carries lesser penalties. After ensoulment, it is equivalent to taking a life. The only exception widely accepted is when continuing the pregnancy would certainly kill the mother — in this case, saving the existing life takes priority. Fetal abnormality alone is generally not considered sufficient justification. Genetic testing that leads to selective abortion raises serious ethical concerns. Prevention through contraception is far preferable to abortion.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['abortion','haram','ensoulment','mother','life','medical']},
{id:'md022',cat:'medical',sub:'Abortion',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on abortion?',a:'Abortion is haram in principle. The exceptions are narrow: (1) Definite threat to the mother\'s life at any stage — permitted to save her, (2) Before ensoulment with valid medical reasons (severe abnormality incompatible with life, serious threat to mother\'s health) — some scholars permit with strict conditions. (3) Rape — a painful situation; some scholars show flexibility before ensoulment. In all cases, consultation with both medical professionals and one\'s marja is essential. Post-abortion, the parents should pay diyah and seek forgiveness.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['abortion','haram','ensoulment','mother','life','medical']},
{id:'md023',cat:'medical',sub:'Plastic Surgery',marja:'sistani',q:'Is cosmetic/plastic surgery permissible?',a:'Cosmetic surgery is permissible if: (1) It corrects a deformity or abnormality, (2) It is done for legitimate beautification without excessive risk, (3) It does not involve haram exposure — meaning a same-gender surgeon performs the procedure when possible, or medical necessity justifies cross-gender treatment. Rhinoplasty (nose job), orthodontics, scar correction, and similar procedures are halal. The intention should not be to deceive (like changing appearance to avoid identification). It is not considered "changing Allah\'s creation" in the forbidden sense.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['surgery','cosmetic','plastic','permissible','beauty','medical']},
{id:'md024',cat:'medical',sub:'Plastic Surgery',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is cosmetic/plastic surgery permissible?',a:'Plastic surgery for corrective purposes (injuries, birth defects, burn reconstruction) is clearly permissible and even encouraged. Cosmetic surgery for beautification is also generally permissible — improving one\'s appearance is not prohibited in Islam. The conditions: no excessive risk, no deception, and following gender rules for medical examination when feasible. The prohibition on "changing Allah\'s creation" refers to fundamental alterations for corrupt purposes, not normal medical enhancement.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['surgery','cosmetic','plastic','permissible','beauty','medical']},
{id:'md025',cat:'medical',sub:'Plastic Surgery',marja:'makarem',q:'Is cosmetic/plastic surgery permissible?',a:'Cosmetic surgery is permissible. Islam appreciates beauty and does not prohibit seeking to improve one\'s appearance through medical means. Common permissible procedures: rhinoplasty, dental correction, skin treatments, scar revision, breast reconstruction after mastectomy, and age-related procedures. The cautions: (1) Don\'t take unnecessary medical risks for minor cosmetic improvements, (2) Don\'t develop unhealthy obsession with appearance, (3) True beauty in Islam is primarily character and faith.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['surgery','cosmetic','plastic','permissible','beauty','medical']},

{id:'md026',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'sistani',q:'Is euthanasia permissible in Islam?',a:'Active euthanasia (deliberately causing death to end suffering) is haram — it is considered murder regardless of the patient\'s condition or consent. Life is sacred and belongs to Allah. However, withdrawing extraordinary life support when there is no reasonable hope of recovery (passive euthanasia/allowing natural death) is a different matter — scholars generally permit this when qualified physicians confirm irreversible brain death. Palliative care to ease suffering, even if it may hasten death as a side effect, is permissible.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['euthanasia','death','permissible','life support','palliative']},
{id:'md027',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is euthanasia permissible in Islam?',a:'Active euthanasia is categorically forbidden. Patients, doctors, and family members cannot authorize deliberate killing regardless of suffering. However, Islamic law recognizes: (1) Not initiating futile treatment is permissible, (2) Withdrawing life support after brain death confirmation is allowed, (3) Pain management is obligatory even if it might indirectly shorten life. The focus should be on palliative care — maximizing comfort and dignity in the dying process.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['euthanasia','death','permissible','life support','palliative']},
{id:'md028',cat:'medical',sub:'Euthanasia',marja:'makarem',q:'Is euthanasia permissible in Islam?',a:'Islam prohibits killing in all forms including euthanasia. "Do not kill yourselves; indeed Allah is merciful to you" (4:29). The alternative is comprehensive palliative care. However, there is no obligation to use extraordinary measures to prolong the dying process artificially. When death is inevitable and imminent, focusing on comfort, spiritual preparation, and dignity is appropriate. Life support decisions should involve medical experts, family, and religious guidance.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['euthanasia','death','permissible','life support','palliative']},
{id:'md029',cat:'medical',sub:'Vaccination',marja:'sistani',q:'Is vaccination permissible?',a:'Vaccination is permissible and often recommended, especially when it prevents serious illness. If vaccines contain ingredients from haram sources (like pork gelatin), the principle of necessity (darurah) applies if no halal alternative exists and the disease poses serious risk. The principle of "la darar" (no harm) supports vaccination when the benefits clearly outweigh minimal risks. Parents should vaccinate children against dangerous diseases — protecting life is an Islamic obligation.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['vaccination','health','permissible','medicine','prevention']},
{id:'md030',cat:'medical',sub:'Vaccination',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is vaccination permissible?',a:'Vaccines are permissible and their use can be obligatory when necessary for public health. The government may mandate vaccination programs as part of its responsibility to protect citizens. If vaccine ingredients include haram-derived substances and no halal alternative exists, medical necessity makes them permissible. Refusing vaccination when it endangers the community may be sinful under the principle of not causing harm to others.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['vaccination','health','permissible','medicine','prevention']},
{id:'md031',cat:'medical',sub:'Vaccination',marja:'makarem',q:'Is vaccination permissible?',a:'Vaccination is permissible and even praiseworthy as a form of preventive healthcare. Islam encourages seeking medical treatment — the Prophet (s) said: "Seek treatment, for Allah has not created a disease without creating a cure." Vaccine hesitancy based on conspiracy theories is unfounded. Any haram ingredients in vaccines are permitted under medical necessity when alternatives are unavailable.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['vaccination','health','permissible','medicine','prevention']},
