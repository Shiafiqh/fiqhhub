{id:'t001',cat:'taharat',sub:'Water Types',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the minimum quantity of Kurr water?',a:'Kurr water is approximately 384 liters. In traditional measurement, it fills a container that is 3.5 spans (shibr) in each dimension (length, width, depth). Kurr water does not become najis by mere contact with a najis substance unless its color, smell, or taste changes. Water less than Kurr becomes najis upon contact with any najasah.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 15',tags:['kurr','water','najasah']},
{id:'t002',cat:'taharat',sub:'Water Types',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on recycled/purified water?',a:'If water has been purified through industrial processes to the point where it no longer possesses the qualities of najis water (i.e., its color, smell, and taste are not affected), and it meets the conditions of cleanliness, it is considered tahir (pure) and can be used for wudu and ghusl. Modern water treatment that removes impurities effectively restores water to its natural pure state.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at, Vol 1',tags:['water','recycled','purification']},
{id:'t003',cat:'taharat',sub:'Water Types',marja:'makarem',q:'Can tap water be considered Kurr?',a:'Tap water connected to a municipal supply system is considered connected to Kurr water as long as the supply system contains at least Kurr quantity. Therefore, tap water has the same ruling as Kurr water — it does not become najis by contact with najasah unless its qualities change. This applies even if the water flowing at any given moment is less than Kurr.',source:'Risalah Tawdih al-Masail, Water chapter',tags:['kurr','tap water','municipal']},
{id:'t004',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the obligatory acts of wudu?',a:'The obligatory acts of wudu are: (1) Niyyah (intention) — intending to perform wudu for the sake of Allah. (2) Washing the face from the hairline to the chin, in a width coverable by the thumb and middle finger stretched. (3) Washing the right arm from elbow to fingertips. (4) Washing the left arm from elbow to fingertips. (5) Wiping the front part of the head with the remaining moisture. (6) Wiping the right foot from toes to the ankle bone. (7) Wiping the left foot from toes to the ankle bone. The washing must be done from top to bottom.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 1, Wudu',tags:['wudu','obligatory','acts']},
{id:'t005',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'sistani',q:'Does touching a dog invalidate wudu?',a:'Touching a dog does not invalidate wudu. However, the part of the body that touches a dog while wet becomes najis and must be purified (washed) before prayer. If the contact was dry (both the hand and the dog were dry), then there is no najasah transferred. Wudu itself is only invalidated by the known nawaqid: sleep, urination, defecation, flatulence, and other specified events.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 84',tags:['wudu','dog','najasah','invalidation']},
{id:'t006',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is it permissible to perform wudu with water that has been heated by the sun?',a:'It is permissible to perform wudu with water heated by the sun. The dislike (karahah) mentioned in some narrations about using sun-heated water applies to using it for ghusl, not wudu, and even that is a recommended precaution rather than an obligation. Water heated by any means — sun, electricity, gas — is permissible for all purification purposes.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['wudu','sun-heated','water']},
{id:'t007',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'makarem',q:'What invalidates wudu?',a:'Wudu is invalidated by the following: (1) Urination. (2) Defecation. (3) Passing gas from the rear. (4) Sleep that overcomes both the eyes and ears. (5) Things that cause loss of consciousness such as fainting, intoxication, or insanity. (6) Istihadah (irregular bleeding) for women, according to its specific rules. (7) Janabah (major ritual impurity from sexual intercourse or ejaculation), which requires ghusl rather than wudu.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Nawaqid al-Wudu',tags:['wudu','invalidation','nawaqid']},
{id:'t008',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'wahid',q:'Is it necessary to remove a ring during wudu?',a:'If the ring is loose enough that water reaches the skin underneath during washing, it is not necessary to remove it. However, if the ring is tight and prevents water from reaching the skin, it must be removed or moved to ensure water covers the entire area. As an obligatory precaution, one should ensure water reaches under the ring even if the ring appears loose.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['wudu','ring','barrier']},
{id:'t009',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'najafi',q:'Can nail polish be worn during wudu?',a:'Regular nail polish creates a barrier that prevents water from reaching the nail surface. Therefore, wudu performed with nail polish is invalid because the water has not reached all the required areas. The nail polish must be removed before wudu. However, breathable nail polish that genuinely allows water permeation — if its permeability is verified and certain — would be acceptable. In practice, most products marketed as "breathable" do not allow sufficient water through, so removal is the safest course.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['wudu','nail polish','barrier','women']},
{id:'t010',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'hakim',q:'What is the ruling on wiping over socks instead of the feet?',a:'According to Shia jurisprudence, wiping must be done directly on the feet (from toes to the ankle joint). Wiping over socks, shoes, or any covering is not valid for wudu. The feet must be exposed for the wiping to be performed correctly. This is based on the Quranic verse and authentic narrations from the Ahlulbayt (as) which specify wiping the feet themselves.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj, Wudu',tags:['wudu','wiping','socks','feet']},
{id:'t011',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the types of obligatory ghusl?',a:'The obligatory ghusls are: (1) Ghusl al-Janabah — after sexual intercourse or ejaculation. (2) Ghusl al-Hayd — after menstruation ends. (3) Ghusl al-Nifas — after postnatal bleeding ends. (4) Ghusl al-Istihadah — for irregular bleeding, according to its categories. (5) Ghusl Mass al-Mayyit — after touching a human corpse that has become cold and has not been given ghusl. (6) Ghusl al-Mayyit — washing the deceased. (7) Ghusl that becomes obligatory due to a vow (nazr) or oath.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 344',tags:['ghusl','obligatory','types']},
{id:'t012',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'sistani',q:'Can ghusl al-janabah substitute for wudu?',a:'Yes, ghusl al-janabah is sufficient and replaces the need for wudu. A person who performs ghusl al-janabah can pray directly without performing separate wudu. However, this ruling is specific to ghusl al-janabah. For other obligatory ghusls (hayd, nifas, mass al-mayyit, etc.), as an obligatory precaution, one should also perform wudu before prayer.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 1',tags:['ghusl','janabah','wudu','substitution']},
{id:'t013',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is ghusl valid under a shower?',a:'Yes, ghusl performed under a shower is valid and is considered ghusl tartibi (sequential ghusl). The person should intend ghusl, then ensure water covers the entire head and neck first, then the right side of the body, then the left side. Under a shower, one should turn to allow water to flow over each section completely. It is not necessary to wipe or rub the body — the flowing of water over the skin is sufficient.',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah',tags:['ghusl','shower','tartibi','method']},
{id:'t014',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'shirazi',q:'What is the method of ghusl irtimasi (immersion)?',a:'Ghusl irtimasi is performed by immersing the entire body in water at once with the intention of ghusl. The person should submerge completely so that water covers every part of the body simultaneously. It can be performed in a pool, river, or any body of water large enough. Some scholars require that the immersion happen in one motion, while it is also acceptable to enter the water gradually as long as the entire body is submerged before the intention is complete.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ghusl','irtimasi','immersion']},
{id:'t015',cat:'taharat',sub:'Tayammum',marja:'sistani',q:'When is tayammum permitted instead of wudu or ghusl?',a:'Tayammum is permitted in the following situations: (1) Insufficient water is available for wudu/ghusl. (2) Access to water is harmful to one\'s health (illness, injury). (3) Using water would cause unbearable hardship. (4) The body or clothing is najis and the only available water is needed for purification, leaving none for wudu. (5) There is insufficient time to perform wudu/ghusl before the prayer time expires. (6) Water is available but using it is prohibited (e.g., it belongs to someone else). (7) One is unable to obtain water that is known to be available.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 655',tags:['tayammum','conditions','water','prayer']},
{id:'t016',cat:'taharat',sub:'Tayammum',marja:'makarem',q:'What surfaces are valid for tayammum?',a:'Tayammum must be performed on earth or things that are categorized as earth. This includes: soil, sand, pebbles, rocks/stones, baked clay, and as a precaution dried mud. Tayammum on carpets, cloth, wood, or plants is not valid. If none of these are available, tayammum can be performed on dust that has gathered on surfaces. If even dust is unavailable, tayammum on mud is permissible. The surface must be tahir (pure) and, as a recommended precaution, should be dry.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Tayammum',tags:['tayammum','surface','earth','validity']},
{id:'t017',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the najis (ritually impure) substances in Shia fiqh?',a:'The najis substances are: (1) Urine — of humans and haram-meat animals. (2) Feces — of humans and haram-meat animals. (3) Semen — of humans and, as a precaution, of animals whose blood gushes when slaughtered. (4) Blood — of humans and animals whose blood gushes. (5) Dead body (maytah) — of humans and animals with gushing blood. (6) Dog — its entire body. (7) Pig — its entire body. (8) Alcohol (intoxicating liquor) — as an obligatory precaution. (9) Kafir — this is a matter of difference; as an obligatory precaution the body of a person who denies God is najis. (10) Sweat of a haram-eating camel.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 83-117',tags:['najasah','impurity','list','substances']},
{id:'t018',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is the sweat of a junub person najis?',a:'No, the sweat of a person in the state of janabah is not najis. It is tahir (pure). The person can pray in clothing that has their sweat on it. However, if the janabah was caused by a haram act, it is a recommended precaution (not obligatory) to avoid praying in clothes that have significant amounts of that sweat. This precaution does not apply to janabah from halal acts (marital relations).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['sweat','janabah','najasah','prayer']},
{id:'t019',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'makarem',q:'Is alcohol in medicines and sanitizers najis?',a:'Industrial alcohol (ethanol) that is not produced for drinking purposes and is not drinkable is not najis, though there is a difference of opinion among scholars. As for alcohol in medicines prescribed by doctors where no alternative exists, using such medicine is permissible, and the alcohol in it does not create a najasah problem if it is a small percentage dissolved in the medicine. Hand sanitizers and rubbing alcohol fall under industrial alcohol and their use is permissible and they are considered tahir according to many scholars.',source:'Istifta\'at, Medical Ethics',tags:['alcohol','medicine','sanitizer','najasah']},
{id:'t020',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on blood spots smaller than a dirham on clothing?',a:'Blood that is less than the size of a dirham (approximately the size of the top joint of the thumb, about 2-3 cm diameter) on clothing is pardoned for prayer — meaning one can pray with it without the prayer being invalidated. However, this exemption applies only to one\'s own blood, not the blood of another person or an animal. Blood from hayd (menstruation), nifas, istihadah, or from a najis-al-ayn animal is not pardoned even if it is a small amount.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Salat conditions',tags:['blood','dirham','prayer','exemption']},
{id:'t021',cat:'taharat',sub:'Mutahhirat',marja:'sistani',q:'How does one purify a najis utensil?',a:'A utensil that has become najis must be washed three times with under-Kurr water (such as tap water). If the najasah was caused by a dog licking or drinking from it, it must first be scrubbed with earth/soil mixed with water, then washed twice with water. If a pig drank from a utensil or a mouse died in it, it should be washed seven times. If Kurr or running water is used, washing once (after removing the najis substance) is sufficient for regular najasah.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 147-151',tags:['purification','utensil','washing','dog','pig']},
{id:'t022',cat:'taharat',sub:'Mutahhirat',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the purifying agents (mutahhirat)?',a:'The mutahhirat (purifying agents) include: (1) Water — the primary purifier. (2) Earth — purifies the sole of the foot/shoe by walking. (3) Sun — purifies the ground, walls, and immovable objects under specific conditions. (4) Transformation (istihalah) — when a najis substance transforms into a different substance (e.g., wine becoming vinegar). (5) Transfer (intiqal) — like blood entering a mosquito becoming its blood. (6) Islam — when a kafir becomes Muslim. (7) Dependence (taba\'iyyah) — when something becomes tahir as a consequence (e.g., a wine vessel becomes tahir when wine turns to vinegar). (8) Removal of najasah from animal bodies. (9) Absence of a Muslim (istibraa of animal).',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah, Mutahhirat',tags:['purification','mutahhirat','agents','list']},
{id:'t023',cat:'taharat',sub:'Mutahhirat',marja:'shirazi',q:'Does the sun purify the ground?',a:'Yes, the sun is a purifier (mutahhir) for the ground, buildings, walls, and other immovable structures under specific conditions: (1) The najis substance itself must first be removed. (2) The surface must be wet when exposed to sunlight. (3) The sun must dry the surface through direct sunlight (not through wind or heat alone). (4) There must be no barrier between the sun and the surface. When these conditions are met, the sun purifies the ground, making it valid for sajdah and prayer.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Mutahhirat',tags:['sun','purification','ground','sajdah']},
{id:'t024',cat:'taharat',sub:'Mutahhirat',marja:'makarem',q:'Does istihalah (transformation) apply to najis substances used in food production?',a:'Yes, istihalah is a genuine purifier. When a najis substance undergoes complete transformation into a fundamentally different substance, it becomes tahir. Examples include: wine naturally becoming vinegar, a dead animal decomposing into earth, najis wood burning to ash. However, mere mixing or processing is not istihalah — the substance must fundamentally change its nature. For food production, each case must be examined: if gelatin has genuinely undergone istihalah from its animal source, it may be considered tahir, but this is a matter of dispute.',source:'Anwar al-Fiqahah',tags:['istihalah','transformation','gelatin','food']},
{id:'t025',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on wudu with a cast or bandage on the hand/arm?',a:'If a person has a wound, fracture, or burn with a bandage, splint, or cast on a wudu area that cannot be removed, they should perform jabira wudu. The method is: wash the exposed parts normally, and for the covered part, wipe over the bandage/cast with wet hands. The bandage must be tahir on its outer surface. If even wiping over the jabira is harmful, or if the wound is open and cannot be washed or wiped, they should perform wudu on the available parts and, as an obligatory precaution, also perform tayammum.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 325-340',tags:['wudu','jabira','cast','bandage','wound']},
{id:'t026',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'hakim',q:'Are Ahlul Kitab (People of the Book) considered najis?',a:'According to the more correct view, Ahlul Kitab (Jews and Christians) are not najis in themselves (tahir al-dhat). This is based on numerous narrations from the Imams (as) that indicate dealing with them, eating their food, and normal interaction is permissible. The najasah mentioned in certain narrations refers to spiritual impurity rather than physical ritual impurity. This is the position of many contemporary Maraja, though some maintain the precaution of considering them najis.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['ahlul kitab','najasah','jews','christians']},
{id:'t027',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'najafi',q:'What is the ruling on leather products imported from non-Muslim countries?',a:'If leather products are purchased from a non-Muslim country and it is unknown whether the animal was slaughtered according to Islamic law, the leather is treated as follows: it is considered tahir (pure) for the purpose of general use and touching, but it is not suitable for prayer (i.e., you cannot pray while wearing it) because the animal may not have been properly slaughtered, making it maytah (dead animal not slaughtered Islamically). However, if there is a possibility that it comes from a halal source or from a Muslim country, one can act on that possibility.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['leather','imported','najasah','prayer']},
{id:'t028',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'sistani',q:'Is a separate ghusl needed for each janabah?',a:'If a person becomes junub multiple times before performing ghusl, a single ghusl is sufficient for all the instances of janabah. Similarly, if a person has multiple obligatory ghusls to perform (e.g., janabah and touching a dead body), they can perform one ghusl with the intention of fulfilling all the obligations, and it will suffice for all of them.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 369',tags:['ghusl','janabah','multiple','intention']},
{id:'t029',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'hamedani',q:'Is it permissible to dry oneself after wudu?',a:'It is permissible to dry oneself after performing wudu. However, the moisture that is used for wiping the head and feet must be from the water of wudu remaining on the hands from the washing — one must not use new water or dry the hands before wiping. After completing all parts of wudu including the wiping, drying is permissible and does not invalidate the wudu.',source:'Risalah Amaliyyah',tags:['wudu','drying','moisture','wiping']},
{id:'t030',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'saafi',q:'What is the ruling on doubting the validity of one\'s wudu after prayer?',a:'If after completing prayer you doubt whether your wudu was valid, the prayer you have already performed is valid and you do not need to repeat it. However, for future prayers, you need to perform wudu again since your current state of purity is in doubt. The general principle is that doubt after completion of an act does not invalidate the act.',source:'Jami al-Ahkam',tags:['wudu','doubt','prayer','validity']},
{id:'t031',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on the fur of cats and dogs?',a:'Cats are tahir (pure) animals — their fur, saliva, and body are all tahir. There is no problem in touching cats whether wet or dry. Dogs, however, are najis — their entire body including fur is najis. If one touches a dog while either the hand or the dog is wet, the hand becomes najis and must be washed. If both are dry, najasah is not transferred. Cat hair on clothing does not invalidate prayer.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['cat','dog','fur','najasah','tahir']},
{id:'t032',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can one enter a swimming pool while in a state of janabah?',a:'Entering a swimming pool while in the state of janabah is permissible. One can also intend ghusl al-janabah while in the pool by performing ghusl irtimasi (immersion ghusl). The person should immerse their entire body with the intention of ghusl. The chlorinated water of a swimming pool is tahir and valid for ghusl. However, if there are non-mahram individuals present, the rules of hijab and covering must still be observed.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['swimming','janabah','ghusl','pool']},
{id:'t033',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'tabrizi',q:'What is the ruling on wudu with makeup on?',a:'If makeup creates a layer that prevents water from reaching the skin (such as foundation, concealer, or thick cream-based products), it must be removed before wudu for the wudu to be valid. If the makeup is merely a color that does not form a barrier (such as some types of eyeliner or loose powder), and water reaches the skin through it, then wudu is valid. The criterion is whether water actually reaches the skin, not whether a substance is present.',source:'Siraat al-Najah',tags:['wudu','makeup','barrier','skin']},
{id:'t034',cat:'taharat',sub:'Tayammum',marja:'wahid',q:'How is tayammum performed?',a:'The method of tayammum is: (1) Make the intention (niyyah) to perform tayammum. (2) Strike both palms simultaneously on the earth (soil, sand, stone, etc.). (3) Wipe the forehead with both palms together, from the hairline down to the eyebrows and the bridge of the nose. (4) Wipe the back of the right hand with the left palm, from the wrist to the fingertips. (5) Wipe the back of the left hand with the right palm, from the wrist to the fingertips. This is the method for tayammum substituting wudu. For tayammum substituting ghusl, as an obligatory precaution, the striking and wiping should be done twice.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['tayammum','method','how to','steps']},
{id:'t035',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on using public restrooms where najasah is likely?',a:'If one is unsure whether a public restroom is najis, it is considered tahir based on the principle of original purity (asalat al-taharah). One is not obligated to investigate. However, if one sees clear najasah (urine, blood, etc.) on surfaces, those specific areas are najis. For istinja in public toilets, if water is available, one should use it. If only toilet paper is available, it is sufficient for removing the najis substance for the purpose of general purity, but as a recommended precaution, one should wash with water when possible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['restroom','public','najasah','istinja']},
{id:'t036',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'sistani',q:'Is bismillah obligatory at the beginning of wudu?',a:'Saying "Bismillah" at the beginning of wudu is a recommended (mustahab) act, not an obligatory one. Wudu is valid without it. However, it is highly recommended to say "Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim" when starting wudu. Likewise, it is recommended to recite certain supplications during each stage of wudu, but these are all mustahab, not obligatory.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 257',tags:['wudu','bismillah','recommended','mustahab']},
{id:'t037',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is it permissible to keep dogs as pets at home?',a:'Keeping dogs inside the living areas of the home is discouraged (makruh) in Islamic jurisprudence. Narrations indicate that angels of mercy do not enter a house where a dog resides. However, keeping dogs for legitimate purposes such as guarding property, herding livestock, hunting, or as guide dogs for the blind is permissible. If one keeps a dog, one must be mindful that the dog is najis — any wet contact requires washing. It is better to keep the dog in a designated outdoor area.',source:'Bayan al-Fiqh',tags:['dog','pet','home','najasah','keeping']},

If removing the covering would cause medical harm, this concession applies.

{id:'t039',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does crying invalidate wudu?',a:'No, crying does not invalidate wudu under any circumstances. The nawaqid (invalidators) of wudu are specifically defined: urination, defecation, passing gas, sleep, and loss of consciousness.

If it is larger, the clothing must be washed before prayer. It is better to wash it in any case. The exemption for small amounts of blood does not apply to blood from hayd, nifas, or istihadah. The blood must also be your own — another person\'s blood on your clothes is not pardoned even if small.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 857',tags:['blood','nosebleed','prayer','dirham','clothing']},

Its time begins at Fajr on Friday and extends until sunset. However, it is best to perform it before noon on Friday.

(2) Wash the clothing with water. (3) For clothing made najis by urine, it must be washed twice. For other najasaat, washing once after removing the substance is sufficient, though twice is a recommended precaution. (4) When using a washing machine, one full cycle with water (after removing the najis substance) is sufficient — the water does not need to be wrung out between washes. With Kurr or running water, washing once is sufficient for all types of najasah after removing the substance.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail, Ruling 162-178',tags:['purification','clothing','washing','machine']},

{id:'t044',cat:'taharat',sub:'Najasaat',marja:'sistani',q:'Does vomit make one najis?',a:'Vomit itself is tahir (pure) — it is not one of the listed najasaat. The contents of vomit do not make the mouth or clothing najis from the perspective of ritual purity, unless the vomit contains blood or another najis substance. Vomiting also does not invalidate wudu. However, one should clean the mouth before prayer as a matter of hygiene and courtesy.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['vomit','najasah','tahir','wudu']},
{id:'t045',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'makarem',q:'Is wudu from a non-Muslim\'s home valid?',a:'Yes, wudu performed with water from a non-Muslim\'s home is valid. The water in a non-Muslim\'s home is considered tahir unless one has specific knowledge that it has become najis. The principle of original purity (asalat al-taharah) applies — everything is considered pure until proven otherwise.

{id:'th093',cat:'taharat',sub:'Water',marja:'makarem',q:'Is recycled water tahir for wudu and ghusl?',a:'Modern water treatment is a form of purification recognized in fiqh. Recycled water that undergoes full treatment — filtration, chemical treatment, and disinfection — returns to its original state of purity. The principle of istihalah applies: the water has been fundamentally transformed from its najis state. This is analogous to rain water evaporating from najis surfaces and falling as pure rain.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['water','recycled','tahir','purification','modern']},

The common method: squeeze from the base of the penis to the tip several times, then squeeze the tip. It is not wajib in itself, but its benefit is that any moisture discharged afterward is considered tahir. Without istibra, any subsequent discharge must be treated as urine (najis).

{id:'th101',cat:'taharat',sub:'Wudu',marja:'sistani',q:'Does touching a dog invalidate wudu?',a:'Touching a dog does NOT invalidate wudu. Wudu is only invalidated by specific things: urination, defecation, passing gas, sleep, loss of consciousness, and other specified events.

{id:'th108',cat:'taharat',sub:'Ghusl',marja:'makarem',q:'Can ghusl replace wudu?',a:'Wajib ghusls replace wudu entirely. This is a well-established ruling.
