{id:'wq001',cat:'waqf',sub:'Definition',marja:'sistani',q:'What is waqf and how is it established?',a:'Waqf is the permanent dedication of property for a specific beneficial purpose (religious, charitable, or public). Once established, the property cannot be sold, gifted, or inherited — it is removed from private ownership permanently. Requirements: (1) The owner must be adult, sane, and acting voluntarily, (2) The property must be specifically identified, (3) A verbal formula of dedication must be pronounced, (4) The waqf purpose must be halal, (5) Possession must be given to the beneficiary or trustee.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['waqf','endowment','permanent','charity','property']},
{id:'wq002',cat:'waqf',sub:'Definition',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is waqf and how is it established?',a:'Waqf is one of Islam\'s most important institutions for social welfare. It freezes property in permanent charitable use. A valid waqf requires: clear declaration, specific property, lawful purpose, and handover. The waqf-maker cannot revoke it once established. Modern waqf can include buildings, land, financial instruments, and intellectual property.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['waqf','endowment','permanent','charity','property']},
{id:'wq003',cat:'waqf',sub:'Definition',marja:'makarem',q:'What is waqf and how is it established?',a:'Waqf is a permanent sadaqah (charity). The Prophet (s) said: "When a person dies, their deeds end except for three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah), beneficial knowledge, and a righteous child who prays for them." Waqf is the primary form of sadaqah jariyah. It has historically funded mosques, schools, hospitals, libraries, and water systems throughout Islamic civilization.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['waqf','endowment','permanent','charity','property']},
{id:'wq004',cat:'waqf',sub:'Management',marja:'sistani',q:'Who manages a waqf property?',a:'The waqf-maker can appoint a mutawalli (trustee/manager) and specify their duties. If no trustee is appointed, the hakim shar\'i (religious authority) or their representative manages it. The trustee must: act in the best interest of the waqf and its beneficiaries, maintain the property, distribute its benefits as specified, keep accurate records, and not personally benefit beyond reasonable management compensation if specified. Mismanagement can lead to removal.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mutawalli','trustee','management','administration']},
{id:'wq005',cat:'waqf',sub:'Management',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who manages a waqf property?',a:'The mutawalli manages the waqf according to the conditions set by the founder. If the trustee cannot fulfill their duties or acts against the waqf\'s interest, they can be replaced by judicial authority. In Iran, the Endowments and Charitable Affairs Organization oversees public waqf properties. The trustee is an ameen (trusted person) and must be just and competent.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['mutawalli','trustee','management','administration']},
{id:'wq006',cat:'waqf',sub:'Management',marja:'hakim',q:'Who manages a waqf property?',a:'The trustee system ensures proper management. Multiple trustees can be appointed. The conditions of the waqf-maker are binding as long as they are lawful. If the original conditions become impractical over time, a qualified mujtahid can authorize modifications that preserve the spirit of the original intent while adapting to new circumstances.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['mutawalli','trustee','management','administration']},
{id:'wq007',cat:'waqf',sub:'Modern Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'Can modern assets be made waqf?',a:'Yes, waqf can apply to various types of property: buildings, agricultural land, shops, apartments, books, equipment, and financial assets. Cash waqf (dedicating money whose profits are used for charitable purposes) is accepted by many contemporary scholars. The key requirement is that the asset must be capable of ongoing benefit while preserving its core. Shares in companies can be made waqf if they generate ongoing dividends.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['modern','assets','cash','waqf','investment']},
{id:'wq008',cat:'waqf',sub:'Modern Waqf',marja:'makarem',q:'Can modern assets be made waqf?',a:'Modern waqf can include: real estate, vehicles used for charitable transport, medical equipment for free clinics, libraries, computer centers, water wells, and financial portfolios whose returns fund charitable work. The principle is flexible — any asset that can provide ongoing benefit while being preserved can be dedicated as waqf. Digital assets and intellectual property are emerging areas of discussion.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['modern','assets','cash','waqf','investment']},
{id:'wq009',cat:'waqf',sub:'Selling Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'Can waqf property ever be sold?',a:'In principle, waqf property cannot be sold. However, exceptions exist: (1) If the property is in such disrepair that it cannot serve its purpose and cannot be repaired, (2) If severe conflict exists among beneficiaries that can only be resolved by selling, (3) If maintaining the property would cause greater harm than selling it. Even then, the proceeds must be used for the closest possible purpose to the original waqf intent. This requires authorization from a qualified mujtahid.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['selling','waqf','exceptions','dilapidation']},
{id:'wq010',cat:'waqf',sub:'Selling Waqf',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can waqf property ever be sold?',a:'Selling waqf is forbidden except in extreme circumstances: total dilapidation with no possibility of repair, or when maintaining it causes serious dispute leading to harm. The ruling authority or hakim shar\'i must approve any sale. Proceeds are reinvested in a similar waqf purpose. Conversion of waqf property (e.g., from a school to a hospital) may be permissible if the original purpose becomes obsolete.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['selling','waqf','exceptions','dilapidation']},
{id:'wq011',cat:'waqf',sub:'Online Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'Can digital assets be made waqf?',a:'The concept of waqf can extend to digital assets that provide ongoing benefit: website domains used for Islamic education, digital libraries, software tools for community use, and online platforms for charitable purposes. The key requirement is that the asset provides ongoing benefit while being preserved. A website that teaches Quran online, for example, could be considered a form of digital waqf if dedicated permanently for that purpose.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['waqf','digital','online','modern','technology']},
{id:'wq012',cat:'waqf',sub:'Online Waqf',marja:'makarem',q:'Can digital assets be made waqf?',a:'The spirit of waqf is ongoing benefit (sadaqah jariyah). In the digital age, this can include: educational websites, Islamic apps, digital book collections, online course platforms, and even social media channels dedicated to Islamic education. While the classical formulation involved physical property, the principle adapts to modern realities. The important elements are: permanent dedication, ongoing benefit, and clear governance.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['waqf','digital','online','modern','technology']},

{id:'wq013',cat:'waqf',sub:'Types',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the different types of waqf?',a:'Waqf is categorized as: (1) Public waqf (waqf \'amm) — for general public benefit like mosques, schools, hospitals, water wells, (2) Private/family waqf (waqf ahli/dhurri) — for specific beneficiaries like descendants, then reverting to public use, (3) Waqf for specific purposes — like maintaining a particular service. The waqf-maker specifies the type, beneficiaries, and conditions. Both movable and immovable property can be made waqf.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['types','waqf','public','family','categories']},
{id:'wq014',cat:'waqf',sub:'Types',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the different types of waqf?',a:'Types include: charitable waqf (for public benefit — most meritorious), family waqf (for descendants — provides generational support), institutional waqf (for specific organizations like hawzas, hospitals), and mixed waqf (combining public and private benefit). Throughout Islamic history, waqf funded universities, libraries, caravanserais, and social services — creating a comprehensive welfare system independent of government.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['types','waqf','public','family','categories']},
{id:'wq015',cat:'waqf',sub:'Types',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the different types of waqf?',a:'Waqf can be: (1) Religious — mosques, hussainiyas, hawzas, (2) Educational — schools, libraries, scholarship funds, (3) Social — hospitals, orphanages, shelters, (4) Economic — shops and properties whose income funds charitable work, (5) Family — providing for descendants. The most rewarding are those with the broadest benefit. Some of the greatest Islamic institutions were built through waqf — Al-Azhar, numerous hospitals in Ottoman era, and the hawza system.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['types','waqf','public','family','categories']},
{id:'wq016',cat:'waqf',sub:'Digital Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'Can digital assets be made waqf?',a:'The concept of waqf can extend to digital assets if they provide ongoing benefit while maintaining their essential nature. A website dedicated to Islamic education, a digital library, or an app providing religious services could conceptually function as waqf. The key question is permanence — digital assets are more transient than physical property. Scholars are developing frameworks for this contemporary issue.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['digital','waqf','modern','technology','online']},
{id:'wq017',cat:'waqf',sub:'Digital Waqf',marja:'makarem',q:'Can digital assets be made waqf?',a:'Digital waqf is an emerging area of fiqh. Potentially valid examples: endowing servers and hosting for permanent Islamic education websites, creating perpetual digital libraries, funding ongoing Islamic apps. The challenge is ensuring permanence — the waqf must be structured so it continues beyond the founder. Setting up a trust fund whose returns maintain digital services could achieve this. The principle of ongoing benefit (sadaqah jariyah) supports creative application of waqf to new mediums.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['digital','waqf','modern','technology','online']},
{id:'wq018',cat:'waqf',sub:'Types of Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the different types of waqf?',a:'Waqf is classified as: (1) Waqf Khas (private) — dedicated to specific individuals or family (like children and descendants), (2) Waqf Aam (public) — for general public benefit (mosques, schools, hospitals, water systems), (3) Waqf Mushtarak (combined) — for both specific beneficiaries and public use. Public waqf is generally considered more meritorious as its benefit is broader.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['types','waqf','public','private','categories']},
{id:'wq019',cat:'waqf',sub:'Types of Waqf',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the different types of waqf?',a:'Categories include: religious waqf (mosques, husainiyyas, madrasas), charitable waqf (hospitals, orphanages, water wells), family waqf (for descendants), and modern institutional waqf (endowments for universities, research centers). The flexibility of waqf allows it to address virtually any social need.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['types','waqf','public','private','categories']},
{id:'wq020',cat:'waqf',sub:'Types of Waqf',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the different types of waqf?',a:'Waqf can serve any lawful purpose: educational (libraries, schools, scholarships), medical (clinics, ambulances), social (housing, food banks), religious (mosques, Islamic centers), and environmental (parks, water conservation). The breadth of waqf categories reflects Islam\'s comprehensive concern for societal welfare.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['types','waqf','public','private','categories']},
{id:'wq021',cat:'waqf',sub:'Waqf Revenue',marja:'sistani',q:'How should waqf revenue be distributed?',a:'Waqf revenue must be distributed according to the conditions set by the waqf-maker. If they specified that income goes to orphans, it must go to orphans. If no specific distribution was stated, the trustee and hakim shar\'i determine the most beneficial use aligned with the general purpose. Operating costs and maintenance come from the revenue before distribution. The trustee may receive reasonable compensation.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['revenue','distribution','income','trustee','conditions']},
{id:'wq022',cat:'waqf',sub:'Waqf Revenue',marja:'khamenei',q:'How should waqf revenue be distributed?',a:'Revenue follows the waqf deed\'s conditions strictly. Misuse of waqf revenue is a serious sin — it is a trust (amanah). Regular accounting and transparency are required. In institutional waqf, proper governance structures (boards, auditors) should oversee revenue distribution. Any surplus should be reinvested to grow the waqf.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['revenue','distribution','income','trustee','conditions']},
{id:'wq023',cat:'waqf',sub:'Waqf Revenue',marja:'hakim',q:'How should waqf revenue be distributed?',a:'The waqf-maker\'s conditions are binding as long as they are lawful. If conditions become impractical over time (e.g., the specified beneficiary group no longer exists), a mujtahid can redirect revenues to the closest similar purpose. Proper documentation of all revenue and expenditure is a religious obligation for the trustee.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['revenue','distribution','income','trustee','conditions']},
{id:'wq024',cat:'waqf',sub:'Historical Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the historical significance of waqf in Islamic civilization?',a:'Waqf was the backbone of Islamic civilization\'s social infrastructure. It funded: the first universities (al-Azhar, Mustansiriyya), hospitals that provided free healthcare centuries before the modern welfare state, libraries containing millions of manuscripts, water systems, roads, and caravanserais. The Ottoman Empire had waqf-funded institutions covering virtually every social need. This system demonstrates Islam\'s sophisticated approach to sustainable social development.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['history','civilization','education','hospitals','ottoman']},
{id:'wq025',cat:'waqf',sub:'Historical Waqf',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the historical significance of waqf in Islamic civilization?',a:'Islamic civilization was built on waqf. At its peak, waqf properties generated revenue that funded education from elementary to university level, free hospitals with specialized departments, hostels for travelers, animal shelters, and even endowments specifically for providing wedding expenses for poor brides. This was centuries before Western concepts of philanthropy and social welfare.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['history','civilization','education','hospitals','ottoman']},
{id:'wq026',cat:'waqf',sub:'Digital Waqf',marja:'sistani',q:'Can websites, apps, or digital content be made waqf?',a:'This is a contemporary question. The principle of waqf applies to anything that provides ongoing benefit. A website that educates people, an app that facilitates Islamic learning, or a digital library could conceptually function as waqf if: (1) it is dedicated for ongoing public benefit, (2) the infrastructure is sustainably maintained, (3) the dedication is formalized. The challenge is ensuring permanence, which is a core waqf requirement.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['digital','website','app','modern','technology']},
{id:'wq027',cat:'waqf',sub:'Digital Waqf',marja:'makarem',q:'Can websites, apps, or digital content be made waqf?',a:'Digital waqf is an emerging concept with great potential. Educational platforms, Islamic apps, digital Quran resources, and online libraries could serve as modern sadaqah jariyah. The key challenges are: ensuring long-term sustainability, maintaining the content, and adapting to technological change. Server costs and maintenance could be covered by a parallel financial waqf.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['digital','website','app','modern','technology']},
{id:'wq028',cat:'waqf',sub:'Digital Waqf',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can websites, apps, or digital content be made waqf?',a:'Innovation in waqf is encouraged. Digital assets that serve the community — educational websites, research databases, Islamic media platforms — can function as modern waqf. The endowment model might include: a financial fund whose returns pay for hosting and maintenance, ensuring the digital asset continues serving its purpose indefinitely.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['digital','website','app','modern','technology']},
{id:'wq029',cat:'waqf',sub:'Waqf and Poverty',marja:'sistani',q:'How can waqf address modern poverty?',a:'Waqf can address poverty through: (1) Microfinance waqf — endowments that provide interest-free loans to entrepreneurs, (2) Housing waqf — properties dedicated to providing affordable housing, (3) Educational waqf — funding scholarships and vocational training, (4) Healthcare waqf — free or subsidized medical services. Modern waqf boards should develop strategic approaches to poverty alleviation using endowment models.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['poverty','microfinance','housing','education','development']},
{id:'wq030',cat:'waqf',sub:'Waqf and Poverty',marja:'makarem',q:'How can waqf address modern poverty?',a:'The historical waqf system was essentially a comprehensive poverty alleviation program. Modern revival should include: income-generating waqf properties whose profits fund social programs, skill-building centers, women\'s empowerment programs, and emergency relief funds. Muslim-majority countries should integrate waqf into national development strategies rather than treating it as merely a religious institution.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['poverty','microfinance','housing','education','development']},
{id:'wq031',cat:'waqf',sub:'Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'Can the waqf-maker set any conditions they want?',a:'The waqf-maker can set conditions as long as they are: (1) Halal — conditions requiring haram acts are void, (2) Possible to fulfill, (3) Not contradictory to the nature of the waqf, (4) Reasonably specific. Examples of valid conditions: "income goes to my descendants who are students of Islamic sciences," or "the building must be used as a library." Invalid conditions: "only my descendants of a specific race" (discriminatory) or impossible conditions.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['conditions','restrictions','requirements','waqf-maker','rules']},
{id:'wq032',cat:'waqf',sub:'Conditions',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can the waqf-maker set any conditions they want?',a:'Conditions must be lawful, reasonable, and clear. The waqf-maker cannot set conditions that contradict Islamic law or public interest. Ambiguous conditions are interpreted in favor of broader benefit. If a condition becomes impossible to fulfill over time, a qualified authority can modify it while preserving the original spirit. Documentation of conditions is essential to prevent future disputes.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['conditions','restrictions','requirements','waqf-maker','rules']},
