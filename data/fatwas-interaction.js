{id:'it001',cat:'interaction',sub:'Looking',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules about looking at non-mahram persons?',a:'Men must lower their gaze from non-mahram women — looking with desire or lust is haram. A casual glance that is not with desire and is unintentional is not sinful. Looking at the face and hands of a non-mahram woman is permissible without lust according to many scholars. Women must similarly lower their gaze from non-mahram men. Looking for the purpose of marriage consideration is permissible — one may look at the face, hair, and general appearance of a potential spouse.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['looking','gaze','non-mahram','desire','hijab']},
{id:'it002',cat:'interaction',sub:'Looking',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules about looking at non-mahram persons?',a:'Lowering the gaze (ghadd al-basar) is Quranic (24:30-31). Deliberately looking at a non-mahram with desire is haram. Looking at the permissible parts (face and hands) without desire for a legitimate purpose (identification, business) is fine. Looking at a potential spouse is explicitly permitted by hadith to facilitate good marriage decisions.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['looking','gaze','non-mahram','desire','hijab']},
{id:'it003',cat:'interaction',sub:'Looking',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rules about looking at non-mahram persons?',a:'The Quran commands both men and women to lower their gaze. This doesn\'t mean never looking — it means avoiding lustful or prolonged gazing. Looking at non-mahram for medical treatment, education, business, and other necessities is permissible. The key criterion is presence or absence of shahwah (desire). If looking triggers desire, it becomes haram regardless of what is being looked at.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['looking','gaze','non-mahram','desire','hijab']},
{id:'it004',cat:'interaction',sub:'Handshaking',marja:'sistani',q:'Is handshaking between non-mahram men and women permissible?',a:'Physical contact (including handshaking) between non-mahram men and women is not permissible on the basis of obligatory precaution. This applies when there is skin-to-skin contact. Handshaking while wearing gloves or with a barrier is technically different but still best avoided. In professional settings in non-Muslim countries, one may explain their religious practice politely.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['handshaking','contact','non-mahram','physical','touching']},
{id:'it005',cat:'interaction',sub:'Handshaking',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is handshaking between non-mahram men and women permissible?',a:'Handshaking with non-mahram is haram. Alternative greetings (placing hand on heart, nodding respectfully) are sufficient and increasingly understood internationally. If one is in an extremely uncomfortable position where refusal would cause significant harm (not mere awkwardness), some scholars allow flexibility, but this should not become habitual.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['handshaking','contact','non-mahram','physical','touching']},
{id:'it006',cat:'interaction',sub:'Handshaking',marja:'makarem',q:'Is handshaking between non-mahram men and women permissible?',a:'Direct skin contact between non-mahram is prohibited. This is based on clear hadith. In modern professional contexts, one can politely decline and offer an alternative greeting. Most people understand and respect religious practices when explained kindly. Using a barrier (glove) is a matter of scholarly debate but best avoided.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['handshaking','contact','non-mahram','physical','touching']},
{id:'it007',cat:'interaction',sub:'Workplace',marja:'sistani',q:'Can men and women work together in mixed environments?',a:'Working in mixed environments is permissible provided Islamic guidelines are observed: (1) Proper hijab for women, (2) Professional conduct without khalwah (seclusion of one man and one woman), (3) Lowering the gaze, (4) Avoiding unnecessary casual interaction, (5) Maintaining professional boundaries. Islam does not prohibit women from working or earning — Sayyida Khadijah (sa) was a successful businesswoman. The conditions apply equally to both genders.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['workplace','mixed','gender','hijab','professional']},
{id:'it008',cat:'interaction',sub:'Workplace',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can men and women work together in mixed environments?',a:'Mixed workplaces are a reality of modern life and are permissible with adherence to Islamic ethics: proper dress code, professional behavior, avoiding fitnah (temptation). Women have the right to work, education, and public participation. The Islamic framework doesn\'t isolate genders but establishes ethical boundaries for interaction. The workplace should maintain respectful professional culture.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['workplace','mixed','gender','hijab','professional']},
{id:'it009',cat:'interaction',sub:'Workplace',marja:'makarem',q:'Can men and women work together in mixed environments?',a:'Co-education and mixed workplaces are permissible with conditions. Islam encourages women\'s participation in society — women were active in early Islamic communities in education, commerce, healthcare, and even battlefield support. The modern workplace should adapt Islamic principles: professional conduct, appropriate dress, respectful interaction, and avoidance of situations that compromise modesty.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['workplace','mixed','gender','hijab','professional']},
{id:'it010',cat:'interaction',sub:'Online Interaction',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rulings on online communication between non-mahram?',a:'Online communication follows the same principles as in-person interaction: (1) Content must be appropriate and professional, (2) Private messaging that leads to emotional attachment or inappropriate content is haram, (3) Video calls where hijab is observed are treated like in-person meetings, (4) Social media use should maintain Islamic ethics. The medium doesn\'t change the ruling — what is haram in person is haram online.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['online','digital','communication','social media','non-mahram']},
{id:'it011',cat:'interaction',sub:'Online Interaction',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rulings on online communication between non-mahram?',a:'Digital interaction is subject to the same fiqhi rulings as physical interaction. Chatting that leads to haram relationships is forbidden. Social media profiles should observe Islamic guidelines. Sending personal photos to non-mahram is problematic. Online platforms for legitimate purposes (education, business, professional networking) are permissible with proper conduct.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['online','digital','communication','social media','non-mahram']},
{id:'it012',cat:'interaction',sub:'Online Interaction',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rulings on online communication between non-mahram?',a:'The internet has created new challenges for gender interaction. Guidelines: maintain the same standards online as offline, avoid private prolonged conversations with non-mahram without purpose, be cautious about emotional entanglement through messaging, use video features only when necessary and with proper hijab. Parents should guide young users in Islamic digital ethics.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['online','digital','communication','social media','non-mahram']},

{id:'it013',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the requirements of hijab for women?',a:'The obligatory hijab requires covering the entire body except the face (from forehead to chin, ear to ear) and the hands (to the wrists). Hair must be completely covered. The clothing must not be tight-fitting such that it outlines the body shape, must not be transparent, and should not be excessively attention-drawing. Feet covering is obligatory on the basis of obligatory precaution. Makeup on the face in public where it attracts attention from non-mahram men is problematic.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hijab','covering','women','requirements','modesty']},
{id:'it014',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the requirements of hijab for women?',a:'Hijab requirements: covering all of the body except the oval of the face and hands to the wrist. The covering must be: non-transparent, not tight or body-revealing, covering hair completely, and dignified. The specific style (chador, scarf, etc.) is not mandated — the conditions matter, not the particular garment. The purpose is modesty (haya), not cultural conformity. What constitutes \'attention-drawing\' varies by context and culture.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hijab','covering','women','requirements','modesty']},
{id:'it015',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the requirements of hijab for women?',a:'Hijab covers the body except the face and hands. The clothing should be: loose enough to not reveal body shape, opaque, and not ostentatious. There is no specific mandated style — any clothing meeting these conditions is valid. The Quran says to "draw their veils over their chests" (24:31) and "lower their outer garments" (33:59). The spirit is dignified modesty, protection of women\'s agency, and redirecting social interaction toward intellect rather than appearance.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['hijab','covering','women','requirements','modesty']},
{id:'it016',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mahram',marja:'sistani',q:'Who are considered mahram (unmarriageable kin)?',a:'Mahram relationships where marriage is permanently forbidden include: (1) Blood relatives: parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, (2) Marriage-related: mother-in-law, father-in-law, stepchildren (after consummation), son/daughter-in-law, (3) Breastfeeding (ridha\'ah): with specific conditions, a wet nurse and the nursed child develop mahram relationships equivalent to blood ties. A woman need not observe hijab before her mahram men, and physical contact (handshake, etc.) is permissible.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mahram','relatives','marriage','blood','unmarriageable']},
{id:'it017',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mahram',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who are considered mahram (unmarriageable kin)?',a:'Mahram categories: nasab (blood) — parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces; sabab (marriage) — spouse\'s parents, spouse\'s children from previous marriage (after consummation), children\'s spouses; ridha\'ah (breastfeeding) — equivalent to blood relations if conditions met (specific number of feedings, within 2 years, from one husband\'s milk). Cousin marriage is permissible in Islam as cousins are NOT mahram.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['mahram','relatives','marriage','blood','unmarriageable']},
{id:'it018',cat:'interaction',sub:'Marriage Proposal',marja:'sistani',q:'Can a man look at a woman he intends to marry?',a:'Yes, Islam specifically permits looking at a potential spouse for marriage consideration. A man may look at the woman\'s face, hands, and general appearance (some scholars extend this to hair and figure while clothed). This should be done respectfully, not repeatedly, and only when there is genuine marriage intent. The woman should be in her natural state (not excessively made up). Similarly, the woman has the right to see the man. This is to facilitate informed marriage decisions.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['marriage','looking','proposal','permission','spouse']},
{id:'it019',cat:'interaction',sub:'Marriage Proposal',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can a man look at a woman he intends to marry?',a:'Looking at a potential spouse is explicitly permitted by hadith. The Prophet (s) told a companion who was considering marriage to "go and look at her." The permission covers: face, hands, and general appearance. Some scholars allow seeing the hair and figure. The key conditions: genuine intent to marry, not for entertainment, respectful manner, and limited occasions. The woman\'s consent to being seen should be obtained.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['marriage','looking','proposal','permission','spouse']},
{id:'it020',cat:'interaction',sub:'Marriage Proposal',marja:'makarem',q:'Can a man look at a woman he intends to marry?',a:'Islam encourages seeing one\'s potential spouse before marriage. The hadith clearly establish this permission. Both parties have the right to see each other. The purpose is preventing later disappointment and ensuring physical compatibility. Meetings should be in appropriate settings — many scholars recommend meeting in the presence of family members. Photographs may also serve this purpose in modern contexts.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['marriage','looking','proposal','permission','spouse']},
{id:'it021',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the requirements of hijab for women?',a:'Women must cover their entire body from non-mahram men except the face (from forehead to chin) and hands (up to wrists). The covering must: (1) Not be so tight as to show body shape, (2) Not be transparent, (3) Not be attention-grabbing (tabarruj). The feet are debated — covering them is recommended/obligatory precaution. Hair must be completely covered. The color and style of hijab are not specified in fiqh — modesty is the principle, not a specific garment.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hijab','women','covering','modesty','requirements']},
{id:'it022',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the requirements of hijab for women?',a:'Hijab requirements: covering all body except face and hands from non-mahram, with loose-fitting, non-transparent clothing. The feet should be covered on obligatory precaution. Makeup that attracts attention is problematic. The chador is the best form of hijab but is not the only valid one. Any clothing that meets the modesty requirements is acceptable.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hijab','women','covering','modesty','requirements']},
{id:'it023',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the requirements of hijab for women?',a:'The hijab should cover everything except the face and hands. The clothing should be: loose, opaque, not perfumed in public, and not resembling typical male clothing. Head covering must fully contain all hair. Islam specifies principles of modesty, not specific garments — this is why hijab styles vary across cultures while all meeting the core requirements.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['hijab','women','covering','modesty','requirements']},
{id:'it024',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'sistani',q:'Is the face veil (niqab) obligatory?',a:'The niqab (face veil) is not obligatory in Shia jurisprudence. The face and hands are exempt from covering requirements. Wearing niqab is a personal choice and is considered a form of additional modesty. Some women choose to wear it as a precautionary measure or out of personal piety, which is commendable but not required.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['niqab','face veil','obligation','hijab','choice']},
{id:'it025',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is the face veil (niqab) obligatory?',a:'Niqab is not wajib. The face may be shown as long as it is not adorned with conspicuous makeup that would attract attention. Covering the face is mustahab (recommended) but not obligatory. Women should not be pressured to wear niqab nor criticized for choosing to wear it — both positions are valid.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['niqab','face veil','obligation','hijab','choice']},
{id:'it026',cat:'interaction',sub:'Hijab',marja:'makarem',q:'Is the face veil (niqab) obligatory?',a:'Face covering is not among the obligations of hijab. The Quranic verse mentions "what is apparent" as excepted from covering, and the predominant Shia view is that this includes the face and hands. However, in situations where showing the face might cause fitnah, additional covering becomes precautionary.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['niqab','face veil','obligation','hijab','choice']},
{id:'it027',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mahram',marja:'sistani',q:'Who are considered mahram relatives?',a:'Mahram relatives (those with whom interaction is free from hijab requirements) include: By blood: parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews. By marriage: father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepparents, stepchildren. By breastfeeding: those who share a milk relationship (specific conditions apply — at least 15 consecutive feedings from one woman). Cousins are NOT mahram.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mahram','relatives','family','hijab','blood']},
{id:'it028',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mahram',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who are considered mahram relatives?',a:'Mahram categories: (1) Nasabi (blood): seven categories listed in Quran 4:23, (2) Sababi (marriage): in-laws as specified, (3) Ridha\'i (breastfeeding): under specific conditions of quantity and timing. The rules are clearly defined — when in doubt, treat the relationship as non-mahram. Adopted children do not automatically become mahram.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['mahram','relatives','family','hijab','blood']},
{id:'it029',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mahram',marja:'makarem',q:'Who are considered mahram relatives?',a:'Mahram relationships are precisely defined in Quran and Sunnah. A common mistake: cousins are NOT mahram despite close family relationships. Another important point: a woman\'s brother-in-law (husband\'s brother) is NOT her mahram — the famous hadith says "the brother-in-law is death" meaning extra caution is needed. Mahram relationships through breastfeeding require specific conditions.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['mahram','relatives','family','hijab','blood']},
{id:'it030',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mixed Gatherings',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for attending mixed social gatherings?',a:'Mixed social gatherings are permissible with conditions: (1) Proper hijab observed, (2) No haram activities (alcohol, inappropriate music), (3) Maintaining modesty in behavior and conversation, (4) Avoiding intimate one-on-one situations with non-mahram. Wedding celebrations, professional events, and community gatherings where these conditions are met are all permissible. Islam encourages social interaction within ethical boundaries.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mixed','gatherings','social','events','permissible']},
{id:'it031',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mixed Gatherings',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules for attending mixed social gatherings?',a:'Attending mixed gatherings is permissible when Islamic standards are maintained. Complete segregation of genders in all social situations is not required by Islam — the early Muslim community had mixed interactions in mosques, markets, and social events. The key is maintaining proper conduct, dress, and avoiding situations that lead to sin.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['mixed','gatherings','social','events','permissible']},
{id:'it032',cat:'interaction',sub:'Mixed Gatherings',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rules for attending mixed social gatherings?',a:'Social interaction is natural and needed. Mixed gatherings for legitimate purposes (education, work, community, celebrations) are fine with proper conduct. Islam promotes social engagement, not isolation. However, gatherings that feature haram elements (alcohol, inappropriate entertainment, excessive free mixing) should be avoided. The atmosphere should be one where faith feels comfortable.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['mixed','gatherings','social','events','permissible']},
{id:'it033',cat:'interaction',sub:'Marriage Proposals',marja:'sistani',q:'How should the process of seeking a spouse work islamically?',a:'The Islamic process: (1) Identify a potential spouse through family, friends, community, or even appropriate online platforms, (2) Investigate their character, faith, and compatibility through trusted sources, (3) Arrange a meeting with proper setting (family presence recommended), (4) Look at the potential spouse (face, hair, build) — this is explicitly permitted, (5) Ask questions about important matters (religious practice, life goals, expectations), (6) Perform istikharah if undecided, (7) Proceed to engagement and marriage contract.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['marriage','proposal','spouse','seeking','compatibility']},
{id:'it034',cat:'interaction',sub:'Marriage Proposals',marja:'makarem',q:'How should the process of seeking a spouse work islamically?',a:'Seeking a spouse is encouraged and should not be stigmatized. The process should be: practical (investigating compatibility), respectful (maintaining dignity), transparent (honest about expectations), and faith-centered (prioritizing religious commitment). The Prophet (s) said: "When someone whose religion and character please you proposes, accept them." Modern methods of meeting (apps, social media) are permissible if conducted within Islamic guidelines.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['marriage','proposal','spouse','seeking','compatibility']},
{id:'it035',cat:'interaction',sub:'Marriage Proposals',marja:'khamenei',q:'How should the process of seeking a spouse work islamically?',a:'Marriage is half of faith — seeking a spouse is a virtuous act. The process should involve: research into the person\'s background and character, supervised meeting, honest discussion of expectations, and consulting with trusted elders. Both parties have the right to accept or reject. Pressure to accept or reject based on wealth, status, or appearance alone goes against prophetic guidance.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['marriage','proposal','spouse','seeking','compatibility']},
{id:'it036',cat:'interaction',sub:'Khalwah',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on khalwah (being alone with non-mahram)?',a:'Being alone in a closed private space with a non-mahram of the opposite gender is strongly discouraged and considered haram by many scholars if there is risk of sin. This is called khalwah. Public places (restaurants, offices with glass walls) where others can see do not constitute khalwah. The Prophet (s) warned against seclusion with non-mahram. Practical measures: keep doors open, meet in public spaces, have a third person present.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['khalwah','seclusion','alone','non-mahram','private']},
{id:'it037',cat:'interaction',sub:'Khalwah',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on khalwah (being alone with non-mahram)?',a:'Khalwah with non-mahram is to be avoided. In professional settings, meetings should occur in visible spaces. In medical contexts, having a chaperone is recommended when possible. Video calls may be an alternative to in-person meetings when khalwah would otherwise occur. The principle is preventing situations that could lead to temptation or accusations.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['khalwah','seclusion','alone','non-mahram','private']},
{id:'it038',cat:'interaction',sub:'Khalwah',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on khalwah (being alone with non-mahram)?',a:'Avoiding khalwah is both a religious guideline and a practical wisdom — it protects both parties from temptation and from suspicion. In modern workplaces, this translates to: open offices, glass-walled meeting rooms, and professional conduct. It\'s not about distrust but about creating safe boundaries that protect everyone involved.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['khalwah','seclusion','alone','non-mahram','private']},
