{id:'jh001',cat:'jihad',sub:'Types of Jihad',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the types of jihad in Shia jurisprudence?',a:'Jihad in Shia fiqh includes: (1) Jihad al-Nafs — struggle against one\'s own desires, considered the \'greater jihad\', (2) Defensive jihad — protecting Muslim lands from aggression, obligatory on all capable Muslims, (3) Offensive/Primary jihad — can only be initiated by the Prophet (s) or an infallible Imam (as) or their specific designee. During the occultation of the 12th Imam, only defensive jihad applies. The emphasis is on self-purification and community defense.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['jihad','types','defensive','offensive','nafs']},
{id:'jh002',cat:'jihad',sub:'Types of Jihad',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the types of jihad in Shia jurisprudence?',a:'Jihad encompasses defense of Islam, Muslim lands, and the oppressed. During occultation, defensive jihad is obligatory when Muslim territories are attacked. The concept extends to cultural and intellectual defense of Islam against distortion. Military jihad requires authorization from qualified religious authority. The emphasis on Wilayat al-Faqih framework means the Wali al-Faqih can declare defensive jihad when necessary.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['jihad','types','defensive','offensive','nafs']},
{id:'jh003',cat:'jihad',sub:'Types of Jihad',marja:'shirazi',q:'What are the types of jihad in Shia jurisprudence?',a:'Jihad al-Nafs (spiritual jihad) is paramount. Defensive jihad requires no specific authorization — every Muslim must defend their land, family, and faith. Offensive jihad is exclusively in the domain of the Ma\'sum (infallible). The greatest jihad is speaking truth before an unjust ruler, as stated in hadith.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['jihad','types','defensive','offensive','nafs']},
{id:'jh004',cat:'jihad',sub:'Defensive Jihad',marja:'sistani',q:'When does defensive jihad become obligatory?',a:'Defensive jihad becomes wajib when: (1) Muslim lands are invaded by hostile forces, (2) The lives, property, or honor of Muslims are threatened, (3) Islam itself is under existential threat. It is obligatory on every capable Muslim (male, adult, sane, physically able) when the threat is imminent and others cannot repel it alone. Women, children, elderly, and ill are exempt from direct combat but may contribute in other ways.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['defensive','obligatory','conditions','invasion']},
{id:'jh005',cat:'jihad',sub:'Defensive Jihad',marja:'khamenei',q:'When does defensive jihad become obligatory?',a:'When an enemy attacks Islamic territory, defense becomes an individual obligation (wajib ayni) on every capable person — it does not require the permission of a scholar or authority. This includes defense against military aggression, economic warfare that threatens Muslim survival, and cultural invasion that threatens Islamic identity.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['defensive','obligatory','conditions','invasion']},
{id:'jh006',cat:'jihad',sub:'Defensive Jihad',marja:'makarem',q:'When does defensive jihad become obligatory?',a:'Defensive jihad is wajib when aggression occurs against Muslim life, property, or sanctities. It does not require special authorization. Every Muslim must participate according to their capacity — some through fighting, others through financial support, medical aid, logistics, or information. Fleeing from defensive jihad is a major sin.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['defensive','obligatory','conditions','invasion']},
{id:'jh007',cat:'jihad',sub:'Rules of Engagement',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the ethical rules of warfare in Islam?',a:'Islamic rules of engagement include: (1) Non-combatants (women, children, elderly, monks, diplomats) must not be targeted, (2) Prisoners must be treated humanely, (3) Destruction of crops, livestock, and water sources is forbidden, (4) Mutilation of bodies is prohibited, (5) Environmental destruction is forbidden, (6) Treachery and breaking treaties is haram, (7) If the enemy seeks peace, Muslims must accept genuine peace offers, (8) Forced conversion is absolutely prohibited — "There is no compulsion in religion."',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['rules','engagement','ethics','warfare','civilians']},
{id:'jh008',cat:'jihad',sub:'Rules of Engagement',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the ethical rules of warfare in Islam?',a:'Warfare ethics are strict: protection of civilians is paramount. Use of weapons of mass destruction is forbidden due to their indiscriminate nature. Chemical and biological weapons are haram. Historical fatwas have prohibited nuclear weapons based on their inability to distinguish combatants from civilians. Proportionality in response is required.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['rules','engagement','ethics','warfare','civilians']},
{id:'jh009',cat:'jihad',sub:'Rules of Engagement',marja:'noori',q:'What are the ethical rules of warfare in Islam?',a:'The ethical framework of Islamic warfare reflects divine mercy: no targeting of non-combatants, no torture, no burning of homes, no poisoning of water, no destruction of religious sites of any faith. The Prophet (s) established these rules 1400 years before modern humanitarian law. Treatment of prisoners follows Quranic injunctions of feeding them and treating them with dignity.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['rules','engagement','ethics','warfare','civilians']},
{id:'jh010',cat:'jihad',sub:'Jihad al-Nafs',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the greater jihad (jihad al-nafs)?',a:'Jihad al-Nafs is the internal struggle against one\'s lower desires, ego, and sinful inclinations. The Prophet (s) called it the "greater jihad" upon returning from battle. It includes: controlling anger, overcoming greed, purifying intentions, maintaining consistency in worship, avoiding backbiting and jealousy, and constantly striving for moral improvement. This is a lifelong obligation on every Muslim regardless of circumstances.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['nafs','greater jihad','spiritual','self-purification']},
{id:'jh011',cat:'jihad',sub:'Jihad al-Nafs',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the greater jihad (jihad al-nafs)?',a:'The inner jihad is foundational — without it, external jihad becomes corrupt. It involves: (1) Takhalli — purging the soul of vices, (2) Tahalli — adorning the soul with virtues, (3) Tajalli — achieving divine manifestation through spiritual perfection. The scholars of ethics (akhlaq) have written extensively on this systematic self-purification process.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['nafs','greater jihad','spiritual','self-purification']},
{id:'jh012',cat:'jihad',sub:'Jihad al-Nafs',marja:'noori',q:'What is the greater jihad (jihad al-nafs)?',a:'Jihad al-Nafs is the essence of spiritual growth. Imam Ali (as) said: "The strongest among you is he who overcomes his desires." This includes fighting laziness in worship, combating negative thoughts, maintaining gratitude, and consistently choosing the harder right over the easier wrong. It is the prerequisite for all other forms of service to Islam.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['nafs','greater jihad','spiritual','self-purification']},
{id:'jh013',cat:'jihad',sub:'Martyrdom',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the status of a martyr (shahid) in Islam?',a:'A shahid (martyr) who dies defending Islam, their land, or the oppressed holds the highest status. Martyrs are considered alive in the presence of Allah (Quran 3:169). Special rulings: a battlefield martyr is buried in their blood-stained clothes without ghusl (in the predominant view), as their blood is their purification. Their sins are forgiven. However, deliberately seeking death is different from bravery in battle — suicide is haram regardless of the label given to it.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['shahid','martyr','defense','karbala','status']},
{id:'jh014',cat:'jihad',sub:'Martyrdom',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the status of a martyr (shahid) in Islam?',a:'Martyrdom in defense of Islam, the nation, and the oppressed is the highest honor. The martyr receives special treatment in Islamic law. However, true martyrdom requires: (1) correct intention (for Allah alone), (2) legitimate cause (defense, not aggression), (3) legitimate authority. Targeting civilians or suicide attacks against non-combatants is not martyrdom but rather forbidden acts.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['shahid','martyr','defense','karbala','status']},
{id:'jh015',cat:'jihad',sub:'Martyrdom',marja:'shirazi',q:'What is the status of a martyr (shahid) in Islam?',a:'The shahid is honored in Quran and Sunnah. Imam Hussain (as) represents the ultimate model of martyrdom — sacrificing everything for justice and truth against tyranny. Martyrdom is not seeking death but standing firm for truth even when death is the consequence. The culture of martyrdom in Shia Islam is rooted in Karbala — resistance against oppression regardless of the odds.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['shahid','martyr','defense','karbala','status']},
{id:'jh016',cat:'jihad',sub:'Peace Treaties',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic position on peace agreements?',a:'Islam strongly encourages peace. The Quran states: "If they incline to peace, incline to it also" (8:61). Peace treaties must be honored as sacred obligations. Breaking a treaty without just cause is a grave sin. The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah demonstrates the Prophet\'s preference for peace even when Muslims felt they could fight. Negotiation and diplomacy should always be exhausted before any military action.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['peace','treaty','diplomacy','covenant','war']},
{id:'jh017',cat:'jihad',sub:'Peace Treaties',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the Islamic position on peace agreements?',a:'Peace agreements are binding in Islamic law. The principle of wafa bil-ahd (fulfilling covenants) is fundamental. However, if the other party violates the treaty, Muslims are released from their obligations. In international relations, diplomatic solutions are preferred. Sanctions and economic warfare against Muslim nations can constitute aggression that justifies response.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['peace','treaty','diplomacy','covenant','war']},
{id:'jh018',cat:'jihad',sub:'Peace Treaties',marja:'hakim',q:'What is the Islamic position on peace agreements?',a:'Islam is a religion of peace at its core. Treaties and agreements must be honored faithfully. The Quran condemns those who break their covenants. Imam Ali (as) in his letter to Malik al-Ashtar emphasized honoring agreements even with enemies. Peace that preserves Muslim rights and dignity is always preferable to war.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Istifta\'at',tags:['peace','treaty','diplomacy','covenant','war']},
