{id:'hu001',cat:'hunting',sub:'Halal Slaughter',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the conditions for halal slaughter (dhibahah)?',a:'Conditions for halal slaughter: (1) The slaughterer must be Muslim (Shia or Sunni — debated for the latter), (2) The animal must face Qiblah, (3) The name of Allah (Bismillah) must be pronounced at the time of slaughter, (4) The four main vessels (throat, esophagus, jugular veins) must be severed with a sharp instrument made of iron/steel, (5) The animal must show movement after slaughter indicating it was alive, (6) The slaughter must be below the larynx. Mechanical slaughter is valid if these conditions are met.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['halal','slaughter','dhibahah','conditions','bismillah']},
{id:'hu002',cat:'hunting',sub:'Halal Slaughter',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the conditions for halal slaughter (dhibahah)?',a:'Halal slaughter requires: Muslim slaughterer, Bismillah, Qiblah direction, cutting the required vessels with a sharp metal instrument. Machine slaughter is permissible if each animal individually meets all conditions — a Muslim must control the machine and say Bismillah for each animal (or for continuous slaughter, the continuous intention suffices according to some views). Stunning before slaughter is debated — it is valid if the animal is still alive when slaughtered.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['halal','slaughter','dhibahah','conditions','bismillah']},
{id:'hu003',cat:'hunting',sub:'Halal Slaughter',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the conditions for halal slaughter (dhibahah)?',a:'The five conditions are: Muslim slaughterer, Bismillah, facing Qiblah, iron instrument, and cutting the four vessels. Modern industrial slaughter can meet these conditions with proper oversight. Pre-slaughter stunning is permissible if it doesn\'t kill the animal before the actual slaughter. Each condition must be verifiably met for the meat to be halal.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['halal','slaughter','dhibahah','conditions','bismillah']},
{id:'hu004',cat:'hunting',sub:'Hunting',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for hunting animals?',a:'Hunting with weapons is permissible if: (1) The hunter is Muslim, (2) Bismillah is recited when releasing the weapon, (3) The weapon is sharp and cuts (arrow, bullet), (4) The animal is wild (not domesticated), (5) The hunter pursues the animal and reaches it dead or with not enough time to slaughter it properly. If the animal is found alive with enough time to slaughter, proper dhibahah must be performed. Hunting with trained dogs is permissible with specific conditions.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hunting','weapon','rules','dog','bismillah']},
{id:'hu005',cat:'hunting',sub:'Hunting',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rules for hunting animals?',a:'Hunting is halal with conditions. Hunting for sport alone (without intending to eat the animal) is strongly discouraged and some scholars consider it makruh or haram due to unnecessary harm to creation. Hunting endangered species is prohibited under the principle of not causing corruption on earth. Modern conservation ethics align with Islamic principles of environmental stewardship.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['hunting','weapon','rules','dog','bismillah']},
{id:'hu006',cat:'hunting',sub:'Hunting',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rules for hunting animals?',a:'Hunting is permitted for food and necessity. The Islamic ethics of hunting include: not causing unnecessary suffering, not hunting during breeding seasons excessively, not wasting the hunted animal, and pronouncing Bismillah. Hunting with trained dogs requires the dog to be specifically trained (mu\'allam) and the hunter must say Bismillah when releasing the dog.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['hunting','weapon','rules','dog','bismillah']},
{id:'hu007',cat:'hunting',sub:'Seafood',marja:'sistani',q:'Which seafood is halal in Shia jurisprudence?',a:'Among sea creatures, only fish with scales are halal (e.g., salmon, trout, tuna, cod, sardines). Shrimp/prawns are also halal according to Ayatollah Sistani. Lobster, crab, octopus, squid, oysters, clams, and other shellfish are haram. Scaleless fish (catfish, eel, shark) are haram. The fish must be caught alive from the water or found dead in a fishing net — fish found floating dead are haram. No special slaughter is required for fish.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['seafood','fish','scales','shrimp','halal','haram']},
{id:'hu008',cat:'hunting',sub:'Seafood',marja:'khamenei',q:'Which seafood is halal in Shia jurisprudence?',a:'Halal seafood includes scaled fish and shrimp. Other sea creatures (lobster, crab, squid, octopus, shellfish) are haram. The fish must have been alive when caught. Fish dying in the net during fishing are halal. Canned fish from Muslim and non-Muslim countries is halal if the fish species has scales, as no Islamic slaughter is required.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['seafood','fish','scales','shrimp','halal','haram']},
{id:'hu009',cat:'hunting',sub:'Seafood',marja:'shirazi',q:'Which seafood is halal in Shia jurisprudence?',a:'Only scaled fish and shrimp are halal from sea creatures. This is based on numerous hadith from the Imams (as). Prawns are included with shrimp as halal. The distinction from Sunni jurisprudence (which permits more seafood) is based on specific hadith of the Ahlul Bayt (as). Caviar from scaled sturgeon is halal; from scaleless varieties is debated.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['seafood','fish','scales','shrimp','halal','haram']},

{id:'hu010',cat:'hunting',sub:'Animal Welfare',marja:'sistani',q:'What does Islam say about animal rights and welfare?',a:'Islam mandates compassion toward animals. Key principles: (1) Animals must be provided adequate food, water, and shelter, (2) Overworking animals is forbidden, (3) Animal cruelty in any form is haram, (4) Slaughter must minimize suffering — sharp instruments, quick cut, (5) Animals should not witness other animals being slaughtered, (6) Entertainment involving animal suffering (bullfighting, dogfighting) is haram. The Prophet (s) and Imams (as) repeatedly emphasized gentle treatment of all creatures.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['animal rights','welfare','cruelty','compassion','treatment']},
{id:'hu011',cat:'hunting',sub:'Animal Welfare',marja:'khamenei',q:'What does Islam say about animal rights and welfare?',a:'Animal rights in Islam are comprehensive: prohibition of cruelty, mandate of proper care, humane slaughter requirements, prohibition of pointless killing, and environmental stewardship. Animals are communities like humans (Quran 6:38) and have rights before Allah. Using animals for necessary human benefit (food, labor) is permitted with the condition of humane treatment. Factory farming practices that cause unnecessary suffering should be re-evaluated.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['animal rights','welfare','cruelty','compassion','treatment']},
{id:'hu012',cat:'hunting',sub:'Animal Welfare',marja:'makarem',q:'What does Islam say about animal rights and welfare?',a:'Islam was the first comprehensive legal system to establish animal rights. The Prophet (s) said Allah punished a woman for starving a cat and forgave a man for giving water to a thirsty dog. Key rights: adequate food and water, rest from labor, medical care when sick, not separating mothers from young offspring, humane slaughter, and not using animals for entertainment that causes them harm. These rights are not optional — they are religiously binding.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['animal rights','welfare','cruelty','compassion','treatment']},
{id:'hu013',cat:'hunting',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'sistani',q:'Is meat from Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book) halal?',a:'The majority position in Shia fiqh is that meat slaughtered by Ahl al-Kitab (Christians and Jews) is NOT halal unless it is confirmed that Islamic slaughter conditions were met (Bismillah, facing Qibla, etc.). Simply being labeled "kosher" does not make it halal. In non-Muslim countries, one should seek halal-certified meat or vegetarian alternatives. If halal meat is unavailable, seafood (with scales) is always halal regardless of the slaughterer.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ahl al-kitab','christian','jewish','meat','halal','slaughter']},
{id:'hu014',cat:'hunting',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is meat from Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book) halal?',a:'Meat from non-Muslim slaughter is not halal according to the predominant Shia view. This includes meat in non-Muslim countries unless specifically halal-certified. Muslims in such countries should: seek halal butchers, eat seafood, choose vegetarian options, or import halal meat. Kosher meat is not automatically halal as the requirements differ (Qibla direction, Bismillah formulation).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['ahl al-kitab','christian','jewish','meat','halal','slaughter']},
{id:'hu015',cat:'hunting',sub:'Halal Meat',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is meat from Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book) halal?',a:'Shia jurisprudence requires Muslim slaughter for meat to be halal. The Quranic verse "except what you have slaughtered" (5:3) implies Muslim slaughter. Meat from Ahl al-Kitab is not halal according to most Shia scholars. Practical solutions in non-Muslim countries: halal stores, ordering online, vegetarian meals, and seafood which requires no special slaughter.',source:'al-Fiqh Series / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['ahl al-kitab','christian','jewish','meat','halal','slaughter']},
{id:'hu016',cat:'hunting',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'sistani',q:'Is gelatin halal?',a:'Gelatin derived from halal-slaughtered animals is halal. Gelatin from non-halal animals (pork, non-Islamic slaughter) undergoes a chemical transformation (istihalah). Many scholars consider that if complete chemical transformation has occurred (the original substance has fundamentally changed in nature), the resulting product is tahir. However, on obligatory precaution, one should avoid gelatin from haram sources when halal alternatives exist. Fish-based and plant-based gelatin are unproblematic.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gelatin','istihalah','transformation','halal','pork']},
{id:'hu017',cat:'hunting',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is gelatin halal?',a:'If gelatin has undergone complete chemical transformation (istihalah) from its original state, it is tahir and permissible. The criterion is whether the substance has fundamentally changed in its chemical properties. Many food scientists confirm that gelatin production involves such transformation. However, using halal-certified or plant-based gelatin is preferred to avoid doubt. Gelatin from fish is always halal.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['gelatin','istihalah','transformation','halal','pork']},
{id:'hu018',cat:'hunting',sub:'Gelatin',marja:'makarem',q:'Is gelatin halal?',a:'The principle of istihalah (chemical transformation) applies to gelatin. If the original animal substance has been so completely transformed that it is now a fundamentally different substance, it is tahir. Many contemporary scholars accept commercially produced gelatin as having undergone istihalah. Nevertheless, for those who wish to be cautious, plant-based, fish-based, and halal-certified gelatin are readily available alternatives.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['gelatin','istihalah','transformation','halal','pork']},
{id:'hu019',cat:'hunting',sub:'Animal Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rights of animals in Islam?',a:'Islam grants animals significant rights: (1) Right to adequate food and water, (2) Right to not be overburdened with work, (3) Right to not be tortured or harmed needlessly, (4) Right to shelter from extreme weather, (5) Right to not be separated from their young unnecessarily. The Prophet (s) condemned those who harm animals and praised those who show mercy to them. Factory farming practices that cause extreme suffering are ethically problematic.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['animal rights','welfare','mercy','treatment','islam']},
{id:'hu020',cat:'hunting',sub:'Animal Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rights of animals in Islam?',a:'Animal welfare is an Islamic obligation. The Prophet (s) said: "Whoever shows mercy to a sparrow, Allah will show mercy to them on the Day of Judgment." This includes: not striking animals on the face, not branding them on the face, ensuring they are fed before their owners eat, and not making animals fight each other for entertainment.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['animal rights','welfare','mercy','treatment','islam']},
{id:'hu021',cat:'hunting',sub:'Animal Rights',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rights of animals in Islam?',a:'Islam was among the first systems to codify animal rights. Key principles: no unnecessary killing, no torture, no deprivation of food/water, humane treatment in slaughter, not separating mothers from nursing young, and not using animals beyond their capacity. Environmental conservation — protecting habitats and species — is an extension of these principles.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['animal rights','welfare','mercy','treatment','islam']},
{id:'hu022',cat:'hunting',sub:'Endangered Species',marja:'sistani',q:'Is hunting endangered species permissible?',a:'Hunting endangered species is not permissible when it contributes to the extinction of the species. Islam prohibits fasad fil-ard (corruption on earth), which includes destroying the balance of nature. The Quran speaks of the earth\'s balance (55:7-9) and humans\' role as stewards (khalifah). Contributing to species extinction violates this stewardship responsibility.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['endangered','species','conservation','environment','extinction']},
{id:'hu023',cat:'hunting',sub:'Endangered Species',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is hunting endangered species permissible?',a:'Hunting endangered species is prohibited under the principle of preventing corruption and maintaining ecological balance. Environmental protection is an Islamic duty. Governments are right to regulate hunting seasons and protected species. Muslims should support conservation efforts as part of their environmental stewardship obligations.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['endangered','species','conservation','environment','extinction']},
{id:'hu024',cat:'hunting',sub:'Endangered Species',marja:'makarem',q:'Is hunting endangered species permissible?',a:'Driving a species to extinction is a grave wrong — it destroys something that belongs to future generations and to Allah\'s creation. The hadith literature contains numerous examples of the Prophet (s) protecting nature. Modern hunting laws that protect endangered species align perfectly with Islamic environmental ethics.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['endangered','species','conservation','environment','extinction']},
{id:'hu025',cat:'hunting',sub:'Stunning',marja:'sistani',q:'Is pre-slaughter stunning of animals permissible?',a:'Pre-slaughter stunning is permissible on the condition that the animal is still alive at the moment of slaughter. If stunning kills the animal before the throat is cut, the meat is haram. The purpose of stunning — reducing suffering — is actually aligned with Islamic ethics of minimizing animal pain. Modern captive bolt and electrical stunning methods that render the animal unconscious but alive are acceptable.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['stunning','pre-slaughter','welfare','halal','permissible']},
{id:'hu026',cat:'hunting',sub:'Stunning',marja:'khamenei',q:'Is pre-slaughter stunning of animals permissible?',a:'Stunning that does not kill the animal is permissible and may even be recommended as it reduces suffering. The critical point is that the animal must be alive when the knife is applied. If there is uncertainty about whether stunning causes death, precaution requires avoiding it. Stunning methods should be evaluated by both Islamic scholars and veterinary experts.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['stunning','pre-slaughter','welfare','halal','permissible']},
{id:'hu027',cat:'hunting',sub:'Stunning',marja:'makarem',q:'Is pre-slaughter stunning of animals permissible?',a:'The welfare of the animal during slaughter is important in Islam. Stunning that renders the animal unconscious (not dead) before slaughter is permissible. The Prophet (s) instructed: "Sharpen your blades and ease the suffering of the animal." Any method that reduces pain while maintaining the validity of the slaughter aligns with this prophetic instruction.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['stunning','pre-slaughter','welfare','halal','permissible']},
{id:'hu028',cat:'hunting',sub:'Vegetarianism',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic view on vegetarianism?',a:'Islam permits eating meat and does not require vegetarianism. However, choosing to eat less meat or avoiding it entirely for health, ethical, or environmental reasons is perfectly permissible. What is prohibited is declaring haram what Allah has made halal — one cannot claim meat is religiously forbidden. The Imams (as) ate meat but also emphasized moderation. Excessive meat consumption is discouraged in hadiths.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['vegetarianism','meat','diet','halal','moderation']},
{id:'hu029',cat:'hunting',sub:'Vegetarianism',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the Islamic view on vegetarianism?',a:'Vegetarianism as a personal choice is permissible but should not be elevated to a religious principle. Islam\'s balanced approach allows meat but emphasizes moderation. Imam Sadiq (as) said: "Do not make your stomachs graves for animals" — suggesting moderation. For health or environmental reasons, reducing meat consumption aligns with Islamic values of caring for one\'s body and the earth.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['vegetarianism','meat','diet','halal','moderation']},
{id:'hu030',cat:'hunting',sub:'Vegetarianism',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the Islamic view on vegetarianism?',a:'Eating meat is halal and recommended in moderation. Choosing not to eat meat for personal reasons is allowed. But declaring halal meat as haram is not permitted. The best approach is the balanced one: eat meat in moderation, ensure it is halal and ethically sourced, and consider the environmental and health implications. Islam promotes a balanced diet.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['vegetarianism','meat','diet','halal','moderation']},
{id:'hu031',cat:'hunting',sub:'Kosher Meat',marja:'sistani',q:'Can Muslims eat kosher meat?',a:'Kosher meat slaughtered by Jews is a matter of scholarly discussion. The Quran says: "The food of the People of the Book is lawful for you" (5:5). However, the Shia interpretation requires verification that all Islamic conditions were met, particularly: the name of Allah (not just "God" in a general sense) was mentioned, and the four vessels were cut properly. If these conditions are verified, it is permissible. Otherwise, on precaution, it should be avoided.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['kosher','jewish','slaughter','ahl kitab','permissibility']},
{id:'hu032',cat:'hunting',sub:'Kosher Meat',marja:'khamenei',q:'Can Muslims eat kosher meat?',a:'The permissibility of kosher meat depends on whether Islamic slaughter conditions were actually met — not just whether a rabbi supervised it. Key concerns: Jewish slaughter methods may not cut all four vessels, and they may use "God" rather than specifically "Allah" or "Bismillah." Due to these differences, it is better to avoid kosher meat when halal alternatives exist.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['kosher','jewish','slaughter','ahl kitab','permissibility']},
{id:'hu033',cat:'hunting',sub:'Kosher Meat',marja:'makarem',q:'Can Muslims eat kosher meat?',a:'While the Quran permits food of Ahl al-Kitab, the practical differences between kosher and halal slaughter create uncertainty. Kosher slaughter does not require facing Qiblah, may not cut all four vessels, and the invocation differs. When halal meat is available, it should be preferred. In situations of necessity (no halal available), kosher may be consumed as it is closer to Islamic requirements than non-slaughtered meat.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['kosher','jewish','slaughter','ahl kitab','permissibility']},
