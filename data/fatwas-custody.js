{id:'cu001',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'Who has custody of children after divorce?',a:'The mother has priority for custody of sons until age 2 and daughters until age 7. After these ages, custody transfers to the father. Conditions: the mother must be Muslim, sane, and not remarried. If the mother remarries, custody transfers to the father. If the father dies, custody returns to the mother even if she has remarried. The father retains guardianship (wilayah) over the child\'s financial and legal affairs regardless of who has physical custody.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['custody','hadanah','divorce','children','mother','father']},
{id:'cu002',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who has custody of children after divorce?',a:'The mother has custody of children (both sons and daughters) until age 7. After 7, custody goes to the father. The child\'s welfare is the paramount consideration. If the custodial parent is unfit (neglect, abuse, immorality), custody transfers to the other parent. In the Islamic Republic\'s family courts, judges may modify custody arrangements based on the child\'s best interest.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['custody','hadanah','divorce','children','mother','father']},
{id:'cu003',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody Rights',marja:'makarem',q:'Who has custody of children after divorce?',a:'Custody follows the framework of mother until specific ages, then father. However, the overriding principle is the child\'s welfare (maslahah). If circumstances show the child would be harmed by following the default rules, a qualified authority can modify the arrangement. Both parents retain the right to visit and maintain a relationship with the child.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['custody','hadanah','divorce','children','mother','father']},
{id:'cu004',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody Conditions',marja:'sistani',q:'What conditions must a custodial parent meet?',a:'The custodial parent must be: (1) Muslim — a non-Muslim parent does not have custody priority over a Muslim parent, (2) Sane, (3) Trustworthy and not known for immorality, (4) Capable of caring for the child, (5) Not hostile toward the child. For the mother: remarriage to a non-mahram man transfers custody to the father. For the father: he must not pose a danger to the child. If neither parent is fit, custody goes to the paternal grandfather, then other relatives.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['conditions','custody','fitness','parent','welfare']},
{id:'cu005',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody Conditions',marja:'khamenei',q:'What conditions must a custodial parent meet?',a:'Fitness conditions include: sanity, Islam (when the other parent is Muslim), moral integrity, absence of dangerous communicable diseases, capability to provide care. Drug addiction, abuse history, or severe mental illness disqualify a parent. The court evaluates fitness based on evidence. The child\'s voice may be heard in court for older children.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['conditions','custody','fitness','parent','welfare']},
{id:'cu006',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody Conditions',marja:'bashir',q:'What conditions must a custodial parent meet?',a:'In South Asian contexts, custody disputes often involve extended family. The Islamic framework provides clear priority rules but allows flexibility for the child\'s welfare. Grandparents and extended family may be granted custody if both parents are unfit. The father remains financially responsible for the child regardless of who has custody.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Ahkam',tags:['conditions','custody','fitness','parent','welfare']},
{id:'cu007',cat:'custody',sub:'Visitation',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the visitation rights of the non-custodial parent?',a:'The non-custodial parent has the right to visit and maintain a relationship with the child. Preventing a parent from seeing their child without valid reason (such as documented abuse) is not permissible. The visits should be arranged in a way that does not harm the child or disrupt their routine. Both parents should cooperate for the child\'s benefit.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['visitation','rights','non-custodial','child','parent']},
{id:'cu008',cat:'custody',sub:'Visitation',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the visitation rights of the non-custodial parent?',a:'Maintaining the parent-child bond is a right of both the parent and the child. The custodial parent cannot prevent reasonable visitation. If disputes arise, a qualified authority can set a visitation schedule. The child\'s emotional wellbeing should guide all decisions. Using children as leverage in parental disputes is sinful.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['visitation','rights','non-custodial','child','parent']},

{id:'cu009',cat:'custody',sub:'Breastfeeding',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rights regarding breastfeeding?',a:'The mother has the right to breastfeed her child and cannot be prevented from doing so. However, she is not obligated to breastfeed — if she chooses not to, the father must provide a wet nurse or formula at his expense. If the mother breastfeeds, she may request reasonable compensation from the father. The recommended duration of breastfeeding is two full years (as mentioned in Quran 2:233). The father bears all costs of the child\'s sustenance.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['breastfeeding','rights','mother','father','nursing','child']},
{id:'cu010',cat:'custody',sub:'Breastfeeding',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the rights regarding breastfeeding?',a:'Breastfeeding is the mother\'s right and the child\'s right, but not an absolute obligation on the mother (except in necessity). The father must cover all expenses. Islamic law strongly encourages breastfeeding for the full two years due to its physical and emotional benefits. If the parents disagree on breastfeeding after divorce, the child\'s welfare is the determining factor.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['breastfeeding','rights','mother','father','nursing','child']},
{id:'cu011',cat:'custody',sub:'Breastfeeding',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rights regarding breastfeeding?',a:'The Quran specifies two years as the complete breastfeeding period. The mother has priority in breastfeeding her child. If she chooses to breastfeed, she deserves compensation. If she cannot or chooses not to, the father provides alternatives. In custody disputes involving nursing infants, the mother\'s physical bond through breastfeeding is given significant weight.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['breastfeeding','rights','mother','father','nursing','child']},
{id:'cu012',cat:'custody',sub:'Financial Support',marja:'sistani',q:'Who is financially responsible for children after divorce?',a:'The father is financially responsible for all children\'s expenses regardless of who has physical custody. This includes: food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare, and reasonable recreational needs. If the father is unable, the paternal grandfather assumes responsibility. If he too is unable, the mother is responsible if she has means. The standard of support should match the father\'s financial capacity and the child\'s needs — neither excessive nor insufficient.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['financial','support','nafaqah','father','children','divorce']},
{id:'cu013',cat:'custody',sub:'Financial Support',marja:'khamenei',q:'Who is financially responsible for children after divorce?',a:'Nafaqah (financial maintenance) of children is the father\'s obligation. This continues until: sons become self-sufficient (usually after education/employment), and daughters until marriage. After divorce, the father cannot reduce support as punishment or leverage. The court can enforce maintenance orders. If the father neglects this duty, the mother can seek legal enforcement and the father is sinful.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['financial','support','nafaqah','father','children','divorce']},
{id:'cu014',cat:'custody',sub:'Financial Support',marja:'makarem',q:'Who is financially responsible for children after divorce?',a:'The father\'s financial obligation to his children is absolute and not dependent on having custody. Divorce does not reduce this obligation. Children should not suffer financially due to parents\' separation. The expenses should cover all reasonable needs appropriate to the family\'s standard of living. Withholding child support is haram and the courts should enforce it strictly.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['financial','support','nafaqah','father','children','divorce']},
{id:'cu015',cat:'custody',sub:'Relocation',marja:'sistani',q:'Can the custodial parent relocate with the child?',a:'The custodial parent should not relocate the child to a distant location without the other parent\'s consent or valid reason. If the move would effectively prevent the non-custodial parent from maintaining a relationship with the child, it is problematic. In cases of necessity (safety, livelihood), a qualified authority can adjudicate. The child\'s welfare and both parents\' rights must be balanced.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['relocation','moving','custody','distance','parents']},
{id:'cu016',cat:'custody',sub:'Relocation',marja:'makarem',q:'Can the custodial parent relocate with the child?',a:'Relocation disputes require careful consideration of: the reason for moving, the impact on the child\'s relationship with both parents, the child\'s established community and school, and the feasibility of maintaining visitation. A unilateral decision to relocate far away with the child, cutting off the other parent, is not permissible without legitimate justification and preferably judicial authorization.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['relocation','moving','custody','distance','parents']},
{id:'cu017',cat:'custody',sub:'Breastfeeding Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'Does a mother have the right to compensation for breastfeeding?',a:'Yes, the mother has the right to demand compensation for breastfeeding from the father. If the parents are divorced, the father must pay the mother for nursing the child. If another wet nurse is available at a lower cost, the father may hire her, but the mother has priority if she matches the price. This right is explicitly mentioned in Quran 65:6.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['breastfeeding','compensation','rights','mother','nursing']},
{id:'cu018',cat:'custody',sub:'Breastfeeding Rights',marja:'khamenei',q:'Does a mother have the right to compensation for breastfeeding?',a:'The mother may request wages for breastfeeding. This is her right even during marriage, though it is better for family harmony to nurse voluntarily. After divorce, the father must provide compensation. The breastfeeding period is up to two full years as stated in the Quran (2:233).',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['breastfeeding','compensation','rights','mother','nursing']},
{id:'cu019',cat:'custody',sub:'Breastfeeding Rights',marja:'makarem',q:'Does a mother have the right to compensation for breastfeeding?',a:'Compensation for breastfeeding is the mother\'s right. Islam recognizes nursing as valuable labor deserving of payment. The father bears this cost as part of his maintenance obligation. If the couple disagrees on terms, a judge can determine fair compensation based on local standards.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['breastfeeding','compensation','rights','mother','nursing']},
{id:'cu020',cat:'custody',sub:'Child Welfare',marja:'sistani',q:'What happens to custody if both parents are unfit?',a:'If both parents are unfit for custody, priority goes to: (1) Paternal grandfather, (2) Paternal grandmother, (3) Maternal grandparents, (4) Other close relatives. The hakim shar\'i (religious judge) determines the most suitable guardian based on the child\'s welfare. In extreme cases, the Islamic authority appoints a guardian from outside the family.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['custody','unfit','grandparents','welfare','guardian']},
{id:'cu021',cat:'custody',sub:'Child Welfare',marja:'khamenei',q:'What happens to custody if both parents are unfit?',a:'The child\'s welfare is paramount. When parents are unfit, extended family takes custody in order of closeness. The court evaluates each potential guardian\'s fitness. Foster care arrangements can be made under judicial supervision. The financial responsibility typically remains with the father or his estate.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['custody','unfit','grandparents','welfare','guardian']},
{id:'cu022',cat:'custody',sub:'Child Welfare',marja:'bashir',q:'What happens to custody if both parents are unfit?',a:'In South Asian Shia communities, extended family networks often step in naturally. The formal Islamic order prioritizes paternal grandparents, then maternal grandparents. Community leaders and scholars should facilitate finding the best arrangement for the child. The child\'s religious education must be ensured.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Ahkam',tags:['custody','unfit','grandparents','welfare','guardian']},
{id:'cu023',cat:'custody',sub:'Relocation',marja:'sistani',q:'Can the custodial parent relocate with the child?',a:'The custodial parent cannot relocate the child to a distant location that would prevent the other parent from maintaining their relationship with the child, without the other parent\'s consent or a judge\'s permission. Short-distance moves that don\'t affect visitation are generally permissible. International relocation requires clear justification and judicial approval.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['relocation','custody','moving','visitation','permission']},
{id:'cu024',cat:'custody',sub:'Relocation',marja:'makarem',q:'Can the custodial parent relocate with the child?',a:'Relocation that prevents the non-custodial parent from seeing the child is not permitted without valid reason and proper authorization. The child\'s stability and both parents\' rights must be balanced. If relocation is necessary (safety, employment), the court can modify custody and visitation arrangements accordingly.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['relocation','custody','moving','visitation','permission']},
{id:'cu025',cat:'custody',sub:'Child\'s Choice',marja:'sistani',q:'At what age can a child choose which parent to live with?',a:'Islamic law does not specify an age where the child\'s choice becomes determinative. However, as the child matures (approaching bulugh — typically 9 for girls, 15 for boys), their preference carries more weight. After reaching bulugh, the child is no longer subject to custody rules and can choose where to live. A judge may consider the child\'s preference even before bulugh for their wellbeing.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['child','choice','age','bulugh','preference']},
{id:'cu026',cat:'custody',sub:'Child\'s Choice',marja:'khamenei',q:'At what age can a child choose which parent to live with?',a:'After reaching the age of religious maturity (bulugh), the child can decide for themselves. Before that, their preference is considered but not binding. The judge evaluates the child\'s maturity and reasoning. In family courts, older children\'s opinions are given significant weight in custody decisions.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['child','choice','age','bulugh','preference']},
{id:'cu027',cat:'custody',sub:'Child\'s Choice',marja:'noori',q:'At what age can a child choose which parent to live with?',a:'The child\'s wishes should be heard with compassion. While young children need adult decisions made for them, adolescents approaching maturity have legitimate preferences that should be respected. Forcing a mature teenager to live with a parent they are uncomfortable with goes against the spirit of Islamic care for children.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['child','choice','age','bulugh','preference']},
{id:'cu028',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody of Disabled Children',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the rules for custody of disabled children?',a:'Children with disabilities require special consideration in custody. The custodial parent must be capable of meeting the child\'s specific needs. If one parent is better equipped (financially, emotionally, in terms of skills), they should have priority regardless of the default rules. Custody of disabled children may extend beyond the normal ages if the child cannot live independently. The father\'s financial obligation continues as long as the child is dependent.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['disability','custody','special needs','care','obligation']},
{id:'cu029',cat:'custody',sub:'Custody of Disabled Children',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the rules for custody of disabled children?',a:'Disabled children deserve extra care and protection. Custody arrangements should prioritize the child\'s therapeutic, educational, and emotional needs. Neither parent can refuse custody due to disability — this would be sinful. The community has an obligation to support families with disabled children through waqf, charity, and institutional support.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['disability','custody','special needs','care','obligation']},
{id:'cu030',cat:'custody',sub:'Interfaith Custody',marja:'sistani',q:'What happens to custody when one parent converts to Islam?',a:'If one parent is Muslim and the other is not, custody priority goes to the Muslim parent to ensure the child\'s Islamic upbringing. If both were non-Muslim and one converts, custody shifts to the convert. The child\'s right to Islamic education and environment is considered paramount. However, the non-Muslim parent retains visitation rights and should be treated with dignity.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['interfaith','custody','conversion','islam','religion']},
{id:'cu031',cat:'custody',sub:'Interfaith Custody',marja:'khamenei',q:'What happens to custody when one parent converts to Islam?',a:'The Muslim parent has custody priority to safeguard the child\'s faith. This applies in cases of conversion during marriage. The non-Muslim parent should not be cut off from the child — maintaining family bonds is important. In mixed-religion families in non-Muslim countries, Muslims should seek legal and religious guidance to protect both the child\'s faith and family relationships.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['interfaith','custody','conversion','islam','religion']},
