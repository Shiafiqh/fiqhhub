{id:'dg001',cat:'digital',sub:'Internet',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for internet use?',a:'Internet use is permissible and can be highly beneficial. Islamic guidelines: (1) Viewing pornographic or sexually explicit content is haram. (2) Online gambling is haram. (3) Spreading false information (fake news) is haram as it falls under lying and defamation. (4) Online backbiting and slander carry the same ruling as in-person. (5) Online transactions must meet the same conditions as physical transactions. (6) Privacy of others must be respected — hacking, unauthorized access to accounts is haram. (7) Using the internet for education, business, communication, and beneficial purposes is commendable. (8) Parents should monitor children\'s internet use to protect them from harmful content.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['internet','guidelines','haram','permissible','online']},
{id:'dg002',cat:'digital',sub:'AI',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on using artificial intelligence tools?',a:'Using AI tools is permissible as they are technological instruments — their ruling depends on the purpose: (1) Using AI for education, research, business efficiency, and beneficial purposes is permissible and praiseworthy. (2) Using AI to generate haram content (pornography, fraud, deception) is haram. (3) Using AI to impersonate others or create deepfakes to deceive is haram. (4) Using AI for homework/assignments may involve issues of academic dishonesty — this depends on institutional rules and the nature of the task. (5) AI-generated religious rulings should not be relied upon without verification from qualified scholars. (6) Income earned through legitimate AI-assisted work is halal.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['AI','artificial intelligence','permissible','tools','technology']},
{id:'dg003',cat:'digital',sub:'Privacy',marja:'makarem',q:'Is hacking into someone\'s accounts or devices permissible?',a:'Hacking into someone\'s personal accounts, devices, or systems without their permission is haram. This falls under: (1) Violation of privacy — Islam strongly protects privacy rights (Quran 49:12). (2) Unauthorized access to property — digital property has the same protection as physical property. (3) Potential for causing harm, defamation, or theft. (4) Breach of trust if one is given partial access and exceeds it. Even checking a spouse\'s phone without permission is not recommended, as it can lead to suspicion and harm. Exceptions: (a) Law enforcement with legitimate authority. (b) Parents monitoring minor children\'s activities. (c) Employers monitoring company-owned devices with disclosed policies.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['hacking','privacy','accounts','haram','unauthorized']},
{id:'dg004',cat:'digital',sub:'Online Business',marja:'sistani',q:'Is dropshipping and e-commerce permissible?',a:'E-commerce and online selling is permissible and follows the same rules as physical trade: the item must be specified, the price known, the seller must have ownership or authorization. Dropshipping (selling items you don\'t physically possess) can be structured permissibly if: (1) The seller acts as an agent (wakil) for the supplier. (2) The buyer is informed about the arrangement (no deception). (3) The item description is accurate. (4) Delivery is reasonably guaranteed. However, selling items that don\'t exist at all (pure speculation) or misrepresenting products would be haram. Digital products, services, and software are valid items of sale.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['e-commerce','dropshipping','online','trade','permissible']},
{id:'dg005',cat:'digital',sub:'Cryptocurrency',marja:'shirazi',q:'What is the Islamic view on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency?',a:'Cryptocurrency is a contemporary issue where scholars have varied views: (1) If a cryptocurrency has genuine utility, is traded on legitimate markets, and has real value, trading it is permissible under general trade principles. (2) Using crypto for haram purposes (money laundering, purchasing haram items) is haram — but this is about the usage, not the currency itself. (3) Mining cryptocurrency using one\'s own resources is a legitimate form of earning. (4) Extreme speculation resembling gambling is discouraged. (5) Fraud schemes disguised as crypto projects are haram. (6) Profits from crypto are subject to khums. The ruling ultimately is that crypto is a tool — its ruling follows its usage and the principles of legitimate trade.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['bitcoin','cryptocurrency','trading','permissible','mining']},
{id:'dg006',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'wahid',q:'Is it permissible for women to post photos online without hijab?',a:'Islamic hijab rules apply online as they do in person. A woman posting photos without hijab on public platforms visible to non-mahram men is subject to the same hijab obligations. If photos are shared only with mahram family members in private groups, the hijab rules among mahrams apply. If a woman\'s social media is public, posting without hijab would violate the obligation of covering from non-mahram men. However, photos shared in all-female private groups where no non-mahram man can see them are permissible. Each person should be mindful that digital content can be shared beyond its intended audience.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['social media','photos','hijab','women','online']},
{id:'dg007',cat:'digital',sub:'Online Learning',marja:'hakim',q:'Is it valid to learn Quran and Islamic sciences online?',a:'Learning Quran and Islamic sciences through online platforms is permissible and praiseworthy. Many scholars and institutions now offer online classes, and this can be a valid means of acquiring knowledge. For Quran recitation: learning from a teacher (even online via video) is recommended to ensure correct pronunciation (tajwid). For ijazah (authorization to teach): some scholars accept online transmission while others require in-person meetings. The key is the quality of the learning and the qualification of the teacher. Online religious learning should complement, not replace, engagement with local scholarly communities where possible.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['online learning','quran','islamic studies','permissible']},
{id:'dg008',cat:'digital',sub:'NFT',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on buying and selling NFTs?',a:'NFTs (non-fungible tokens) representing ownership of digital art or assets can be traded if: (1) The underlying asset has legitimate value (genuine digital art, not fraudulent). (2) The transaction is transparent and not deceptive. (3) The content of the NFT is halal (not inappropriate images or haram content). (4) It is not a pyramid scheme or scam. (5) The speculation is reasonable and based on genuine market dynamics, not pure gambling. NFTs representing ownership of real assets (real estate tokens, etc.) follow the rules of trading those underlying assets. As with all digital assets, profits are subject to khums.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['NFT','digital art','trading','permissible','blockchain']},
{id:'dg009',cat:'digital',sub:'Online Gambling',marja:'makarem',q:'Is online gambling and betting permissible?',a:'All forms of gambling (qimar) are haram in Islam — online gambling carries the same ruling as physical gambling. This includes: (1) Online casinos. (2) Sports betting. (3) Poker and card games for money. (4) Lottery and raffle tickets. (5) Any game where money is wagered and the outcome is based on chance. Games of skill where entry fees are paid and prizes are won are also debated — if the element of chance is significant, it falls under gambling. Fantasy sports leagues with entry fees are also problematic. Money won through gambling is haram income and must not be used. Video game loot boxes purchased with real money may also fall under this if they rely on chance.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['gambling','online','betting','haram','lottery']},
{id:'dg010',cat:'digital',sub:'Digital Rights',marja:'sistani',q:'Is pirating software, movies, or books permissible?',a:'This is a contemporary issue with scholarly discussion. Intellectual property rights are recognized in Islamic jurisprudence by many scholars, meaning that: (1) Software, books, and content created by others have value and the creator has rights. (2) Pirating content that is under copyright violates the creator\'s rights. (3) If one cannot afford the product and there is no free alternative, some scholars are more lenient. (4) Copying for personal educational use without distribution has a different discussion. (5) In Muslim-majority countries where copyright laws are in place, violating them may also be haram as violating legitimate law of the land. The recommended approach is to respect creators\' rights and use legitimate channels.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['piracy','software','copyright','intellectual property','permissible']},
{id:'dg011',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for social media use?',a:'Social media is permissible as a communication and information tool. Guidelines: (1) Do not spread lies, rumors, or unverified information — the Quran commands verifying news (49:6). (2) Backbiting (ghibah) online is the same sin as in person. (3) Inappropriate content — viewing, sharing, or creating indecent content is haram. (4) Hijab applies in photos and videos posted online. (5) Excessive use that neglects obligations (prayer, family, work) is sinful. (6) Online harassment, trolling, and cyberbullying are haram.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['social media','digital','online','guidelines','content','islam']},
{id:'dg012',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for social media use?',a:'Social media is a powerful tool that can be used for great good or great harm. Positive uses: spreading knowledge, Islamic education, connecting communities, supporting causes. Negative uses: spreading fitna, gossip, inappropriate content, wasting time. Muslims should be intentional about social media use, curate their feeds for beneficial content, and be mindful of their digital footprint. What you post online is a form of testimony — ensure it reflects well on you and your faith.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','digital','online','guidelines','content','islam']},
{id:'dg013',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for social media use?',a:'Social media etiquette from an Islamic perspective: (1) Share only what is true and beneficial, (2) Don\'t engage in online arguments that generate more heat than light, (3) Protect your privacy and that of others — don\'t share private information, (4) Be kind in comments and interactions, (5) Use platforms for da\'wah and positive content, (6) Don\'t let social media replace real human connection and face-to-face community. The principles of amr bil ma\'ruf apply online as they do offline.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','digital','online','guidelines','content','islam']},
{id:'dg014',cat:'digital',sub:'AI',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on artificial intelligence?',a:'Artificial intelligence as a technology is permissible — it is a tool created by human ingenuity. The ruling depends on its application: (1) AI for beneficial purposes (medical diagnosis, education, research, efficiency) is encouraged. (2) AI for harmful purposes (surveillance, weapons, deception, deepfakes for fraud) is haram. (3) AI-generated content should be identified as such — presenting AI work as human work for deception is dishonest. (4) AI should not replace human judgment in matters of fiqh, ethics, and spirituality.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['AI','artificial intelligence','technology','ethics','halal','digital']},
{id:'dg015',cat:'digital',sub:'AI',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on artificial intelligence?',a:'Technology including AI must serve human welfare and Islamic values. AI has immense potential for positive impact: advancing medicine, improving education accessibility, solving complex problems. However, ethical boundaries apply: AI must not be used for mass surveillance against innocent people, creation of autonomous weapons, manipulation of public opinion, or production of haram content. Muslims should be at the forefront of ethical AI development, ensuring technology serves justice and human dignity.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['AI','artificial intelligence','technology','ethics','halal','digital']},
{id:'dg016',cat:'digital',sub:'AI',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on artificial intelligence?',a:'Islam encourages beneficial knowledge and technology — the Quran repeatedly calls people to think, observe, and understand the world. AI is part of this human quest for knowledge. However, like all tools, its morality depends on usage. Key ethical considerations: (1) AI should enhance human capability, not replace human responsibility, (2) Deepfakes and AI deception are forms of lying — haram, (3) AI in Islamic studies should supplement, not replace, human scholarship, (4) Economic disruption from AI should be managed with Islamic principles of social justice.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['AI','artificial intelligence','technology','ethics','halal','digital']},
{id:'dg017',cat:'digital',sub:'Digital Privacy',marja:'sistani',q:'What does Islam say about digital privacy?',a:'Islam strongly protects privacy — the Quran prohibits spying (tajassus) and entering homes without permission (49:12, 24:27). In the digital context: (1) Hacking into someone\'s accounts, devices, or data is haram — it is equivalent to breaking into their home. (2) Reading someone\'s private messages without permission is haram. (3) Sharing someone\'s private information or photos without consent is haram. (4) Companies collecting personal data without knowledge or consent violates Islamic privacy principles. (5) Governments conducting mass surveillance of innocent citizens is prohibited.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['privacy','digital','hacking','surveillance','islam','rights']},
{id:'dg018',cat:'digital',sub:'Digital Privacy',marja:'khamenei',q:'What does Islam say about digital privacy?',a:'Digital privacy extends from the well-established Islamic principle of hurmat (sanctity) of personal space. Unauthorized access to digital information is equivalent to unauthorized entry into someone\'s home. This applies to: hacking, unauthorized surveillance, doxxing (publishing personal information), and sharing private communications. Even parents accessing adult children\'s private communications without cause raises ethical concerns. The principle is: people have a right to privacy unless there is a legitimate and proportionate reason to breach it.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['privacy','digital','hacking','surveillance','islam','rights']},
{id:'dg019',cat:'digital',sub:'Video Games',marja:'sistani',q:'Are video games permissible in Islam?',a:'Video games are permissible in general, provided: (1) The content does not include haram elements as the primary focus (excessive nudity, promotion of gambling as desirable, glorification of anti-Islamic values), (2) Gaming does not lead to neglect of obligatory duties (prayer, work, family responsibilities), (3) The time spent is reasonable and does not constitute harmful addiction, (4) Competitive gaming with monetary prizes is permissible if skill-based (not gambling). Violence in games is a broader ethical discussion — while not directly haram, games that desensitize to real violence raise concerns.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['video games','gaming','halal','entertainment','permissible','addiction']},
{id:'dg020',cat:'digital',sub:'Video Games',marja:'khamenei',q:'Are video games permissible in Islam?',a:'The ruling on video games depends on their content and the player\'s behavior. Games that develop skills (strategy, problem-solving, education) are positive. Games that are primarily about indecent content, promoting gambling, or excessive violence can be problematic. The biggest concern is addiction and time-wasting — gaming that prevents prayer, causes academic failure, or damages family relationships has become sinful regardless of game content. Parents should monitor children\'s gaming.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['video games','gaming','halal','entertainment','permissible','addiction']},
{id:'dg021',cat:'digital',sub:'Video Games',marja:'makarem',q:'Are video games permissible in Islam?',a:'Video games are halal as entertainment within limits. The framework: (1) Content should not be primarily haram, (2) Time should be controlled — set limits, (3) It should not replace productive activities, social interaction, or worship, (4) E-sports and competitive gaming for prizes based on skill are permissible. Online gaming adds considerations: interactions with other players should follow Islamic ethics (no foul language, no cheating). Games are a recreational tool — like any tool, their moral value depends on how they are used.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['video games','gaming','halal','entertainment','permissible','addiction']},
{id:'dg022',cat:'digital',sub:'NFTs',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on NFTs and digital art?',a:'NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) as proof of ownership of digital assets are evaluated like any commercial transaction. If the underlying asset is halal (legitimate digital art, music, collectibles), the NFT trade is permissible. The conditions of valid trade apply: known commodity, agreed price, no excessive gharar (uncertainty). Speculative trading of NFTs with no inherent value (buying solely to flip for profit based on hype) approaches gambling and is problematic. Digital art itself is halal as long as its content is permissible.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['NFT','digital art','blockchain','halal','trading','technology']},
{id:'dg023',cat:'digital',sub:'NFTs',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the ruling on NFTs and digital art?',a:'NFTs are a new commercial format and are permissible when they represent genuine assets with real utility or artistic value. The concerns mirror cryptocurrency concerns: avoid pure speculation, don\'t invest essential funds, and ensure the underlying content is halal. Creating and selling digital art as NFTs is halal — artists have the right to monetize their work. Buying NFTs of haram content (inappropriate images, etc.) is haram regardless of the technology.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['NFT','digital art','blockchain','halal','trading','technology']},

{id:'dg024',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'sistani',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for social media use?',a:'Social media use is permissible within Islamic guidelines: (1) Content shared must not be haram (backbiting, lies, indecent material), (2) Time spent should not neglect obligations (prayer, family, work), (3) Privacy of others must be respected — sharing others\' photos or personal information without consent is wrong, (4) Debates should be conducted with adab (manners), (5) Following accounts that regularly post haram content is problematic. Social media can be used positively for education, da\'wah, and community building.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['social media','guidelines','ethics','privacy','content']},
{id:'dg025',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'khamenei',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for social media use?',a:'Social media is a powerful tool that can be used for great good or harm. Guidelines: avoid spreading unverified news (the Quran warns against accepting news without verification — 49:6), maintain Islamic ethics in all interactions, protect personal and family privacy, use platforms for Islamic education and positive community engagement, and set healthy boundaries on usage time. Parents should guide children\'s social media use.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','guidelines','ethics','privacy','content']},
{id:'dg026',cat:'digital',sub:'Social Media',marja:'makarem',q:'What are the Islamic guidelines for social media use?',a:'Islamic social media ethics include: truthfulness in posts, avoiding ghibah (backbiting) even in subtle forms like vague-posting, respecting intellectual property, not promoting haram content even through likes and shares, maintaining hijab standards in photos and videos, and using the platform to benefit others. Addiction to social media that disrupts real-life responsibilities and relationships is a form of israf (waste) of time.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','guidelines','ethics','privacy','content']},
{id:'dg027',cat:'digital',sub:'AI and Technology',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on artificial intelligence?',a:'Technology including AI is a tool — its permissibility depends on its use. AI for beneficial purposes (medical diagnosis, education, scientific research, accessibility) is praiseworthy. AI for harmful purposes (surveillance, deepfakes, autonomous weapons targeting civilians, replacing human judgment in religious matters) is problematic. AI cannot issue fatwas or replace human scholars in religious authority. The development of AI should follow ethical principles aligned with Islamic values of justice, truth, and human dignity.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['artificial intelligence','AI','technology','ethics','permissible']},
{id:'dg028',cat:'digital',sub:'AI and Technology',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on artificial intelligence?',a:'AI represents both opportunity and challenge for the Muslim world. Muslims should actively participate in AI development rather than being passive consumers. Key ethical considerations: AI must not be used for deception (deepfakes), mass surveillance, or replacing human moral judgment. AI can assist in Islamic research (hadith analysis, fiqh databases) but cannot replace the mujtahid\'s role. The Islamic world should develop AI within its own ethical framework.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['artificial intelligence','AI','technology','ethics','permissible']},
{id:'dg029',cat:'digital',sub:'AI and Technology',marja:'makarem',q:'What is the Islamic perspective on artificial intelligence?',a:'Islam encourages the pursuit of knowledge and beneficial technology. AI is permissible and even praiseworthy when used for good: healthcare advancement, educational access, solving complex problems, and improving quality of life. Concerns include: privacy violations, job displacement (which Islamic economics should address), autonomous weapons, and the potential for AI to be used for mass manipulation. Ethical AI development aligned with Islamic values is a priority.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['artificial intelligence','AI','technology','ethics','permissible']},
{id:'dg030',cat:'digital',sub:'Privacy',marja:'sistani',q:'What does Islam say about digital privacy?',a:'Islam strongly protects privacy. The Quran prohibits spying (tajassus — 49:12). This extends to digital privacy: (1) Hacking into others\' accounts is haram, (2) Reading someone\'s private messages without permission is like opening their mail, (3) Surveillance without legitimate legal authority is forbidden, (4) Sharing others\' private photos or conversations is a violation. Even parents should respect adolescents\' reasonable privacy while maintaining appropriate oversight.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['privacy','digital','surveillance','hacking','data']},
