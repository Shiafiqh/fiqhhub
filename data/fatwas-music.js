{id:'mu001',cat:'music',sub:'General Ruling',marja:'sistani',q:'What is the ruling on listening to music?',a:'Music that is suitable for gatherings of sin and entertainment (lahw) — known as ghina\' — is haram to listen to and produce. Ghina\' refers to singing with melodious vocal modulation (tarji\') that is befitting of gatherings of entertainment and sin. Music that does not fall into this category — such as martial music, revolutionary songs, mourning melodies (latmiyyat) for Ahlulbayt, and background sounds — is permissible. The standard is whether the music, by its nature and quality, belongs to the category of lahw and sinful entertainment. This requires case-by-case assessment, and individuals should exercise their own judgment based on this criterion.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin, Vol 2',tags:['music','haram','ghina','lahw','entertainment']},
{id:'mu002',cat:'music',sub:'General Ruling',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the difference between halal and haram music?',a:'The distinction is between mutrib (excitement-inducing) music suitable for gatherings of lahw and sin, versus other types. Haram music: that which, by its nature, is suited for sinful entertainment gatherings — regardless of the instruments used. This includes most pop, dance, and entertainment music. Permissible music: revolutionary songs, mourning chants for Ahlulbayt, educational music, and sounds that do not have the quality of lahw even if produced by instruments. The criterion is not the instrument itself but the quality and nature of the produced sound. Individuals should assess honestly whether specific music falls into the lahw category.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['music','halal','haram','distinction','mutrib']},
{id:'mu003',cat:'music',sub:'Instruments',marja:'makarem',q:'Is playing musical instruments permissible?',a:'Playing musical instruments that produce lahw-suitable music (suitable for sinful entertainment) is haram. This applies to instruments commonly associated with entertainment gatherings. However, using instruments for non-lahw purposes — such as producing revolutionary music, educational content, or mourning sounds for religious occasions — may be permissible depending on the output. The drum (daf/tablah) for religious gatherings is generally more accepted. Learning an instrument is not inherently haram, but using it to produce haram music is. The ruling ultimately follows the produced sound: if the resulting music is lahw-type, it is haram regardless of which instrument is used.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['instruments','playing','halal','haram','lahw']},
{id:'mu004',cat:'music',sub:'Quran Recitation',marja:'sistani',q:'Is reciting Quran with musical melody (talhin) permissible?',a:'Reciting the Quran with a beautiful voice (tartil) is recommended and encouraged by narrations. However, reciting it with ghina\' (the type of melodious modulation suited for sinful entertainment) is haram. The distinction: beautifying one\'s voice and applying the rules of tajwid with pleasant melody is permissible and praiseworthy. Applying the modulations and styles of entertainment singing to Quranic recitation — making it sound like a song — is not permissible. If a style of recitation is such that people of sound judgment would consider it ghina\', it falls under the prohibition. This is a fine line that requires individual judgment.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['quran','recitation','melody','ghina','tartil']},
{id:'mu005',cat:'music',sub:'Movies',marja:'shirazi',q:'Is watching movies and TV shows permissible?',a:'Watching movies and TV shows is permissible if the content does not include: (1) Scenes of a sexual nature or nudity that one is required to look away from. (2) Content that promotes haram beliefs (atheism, deviation) presented persuasively without critical engagement. (3) Excessive violence that desensitizes the viewer. (4) Haram music as soundtrack — though this last point is debated. Educational, documentary, historical, and clean entertainment content is generally permissible. Watching content that includes non-mahram women without hijab is permissible if it is not with lustful intent (shahwah) and the women are not known personally. The viewer should exercise discretion and avoid content that corrupts faith or morals.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['movies','TV','watching','permissible','content']},
{id:'mu006',cat:'music',sub:'Social Media',marja:'khamenei',q:'What is the ruling on TikTok and social media content?',a:'Using social media platforms is permissible in itself. However, the content one creates and consumes must comply with Islamic principles: (1) Creating or viewing sexually suggestive content is not permissible. (2) Spreading falsehood, backbiting, or slander through these platforms is haram. (3) Women appearing without hijab in public posts/videos is subject to hijab rulings. (4) Music in videos follows the general music rulings. (5) Wasting excessive time that neglects obligations (prayer, work, family) is sinful. (6) Content that provides genuine benefit — educational, dawah, business — is permissible and potentially rewarding. Social media is a tool: its ruling depends on how it is used.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['social media','tiktok','permissible','content','rules']},
{id:'mu007',cat:'music',sub:'Gaming',marja:'sistani',q:'Is playing video games permissible?',a:'Playing video games is permissible in principle, provided: (1) The content does not include haram elements that actively promote deviation. (2) It does not involve real gambling with real money stakes. (3) It does not lead to neglect of obligations (prayer, work, family duties). (4) It does not consume excessive time to the point of addiction and harm. (5) Online games where one gambles with real currency are haram. Games involving strategy, puzzle-solving, sports simulation, and general entertainment are permissible. The concern is not the medium but the content and the impact on one\'s duties and wellbeing. Moderation is key.',source:'Istifta\'at',tags:['video games','gaming','permissible','gambling','time']},
{id:'mu008',cat:'music',sub:'Mourning',marja:'makarem',q:'Is it permissible to use drums and instruments in Muharram mourning?',a:'Using drums (tabl) in Muharram mourning processions for maintaining rhythm in latmiyyah (chest-beating) is permissible according to many scholars, as long as the overall atmosphere is one of mourning and remembrance, not entertainment. The sounds produced must not resemble entertainment music (lahw). Narrations encourage mourning for Imam Hussain (as) through various means. However, converting mourning gatherings into entertainment-like events with lahw music is not permissible. The spirit of mourning must be maintained. Some scholars are more cautious about any instrumental use and prefer voice-only mourning.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['mourning','muharram','drums','instruments','latmiyyah']},
{id:'mu009',cat:'music',sub:'Photography',marja:'hakim',q:'Is photography and videography permissible?',a:'Photography and videography are permissible in themselves. The prohibition that existed historically was regarding sculpture (making three-dimensional statues of animate beings), which is haram or strongly discouraged. Photographs and videos are not three-dimensional sculptures and are permissible. However, the content must be appropriate: (1) Photographing non-mahram individuals inappropriately is governed by rules of looking. (2) Taking photos in forbidden places or circumstances is subject to those rules. (3) Photography as a profession is halal. (4) Family photos, documentation, journalism, educational content — all permissible. (5) Using photos for haram purposes (like distributing inappropriate images) is haram due to the purpose, not the photography itself.',source:'Misbah al-Minhaj',tags:['photography','videography','images','permissible','statues']},
{id:'mu010',cat:'music',sub:'Singing',marja:'wahid',q:'Is singing permissible for women among other women?',a:'Singing among women exclusively (no non-mahram men present or hearing) is subject to the general ruling on ghina\'. If the singing constitutes ghina\' (melodious modulation suited for entertainment gatherings of sin), it remains haram regardless of the audience being all-female. However, singing that does not reach the level of ghina\' — such as celebratory chants at women\'s gatherings, lullabies, or devotional songs in modest tones — is permissible. Wedding celebrations among women where joyful songs (not lahw-type) are sung are generally permitted. The key criterion remains whether the singing qualifies as ghina\' in nature and quality.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin',tags:['singing','women','gatherings','ghina','wedding']},
{id:'mu011',cat:'music',sub:'Instruments',marja:'sistani',q:'Are musical instruments permissible?',a:'Musical instruments designed primarily for haram entertainment gatherings (lahwi) are haram to play, sell, buy, and keep. Instruments used for non-lahwi purposes (military marching, mourning ceremonies, educational purposes) are permissible. The distinction between lahwi and non-lahwi instruments depends on their common usage and context. Daf (frame drum) used in legitimate celebrations and religious ceremonies is generally accepted. The key criterion is whether the instrument and its usage are associated with sinful entertainment gatherings.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['instruments','music','halal','haram','lahwi','permissible']},
{id:'mu012',cat:'music',sub:'Instruments',marja:'khamenei',q:'Are musical instruments permissible?',a:'The ruling depends on whether the instrument is associated with sinful gatherings (majalis al-lahw). Instruments used in revolutionary songs, religious nasheeds, and legitimate occasions are permissible. In the Islamic Republic framework, music approved by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is considered halal. Instruments are tools — their ruling depends on usage. Traditional instruments used for majalis (mourning gatherings), weddings, and national occasions are accepted.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['instruments','music','halal','haram','lahwi','permissible']},
{id:'mu013',cat:'music',sub:'Instruments',marja:'makarem',q:'Are musical instruments permissible?',a:'Musical instruments are categorized by their common association: (1) Instruments primarily associated with sinful entertainment — haram, (2) Instruments that can serve multiple purposes — depends on context. The daf and some percussion instruments are widely accepted for celebrations. String instruments and others are more debated. In practice: instruments used for nasheed, religious music, educational music, and legitimate cultural expression are accepted by many contemporary scholars.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['instruments','music','halal','haram','lahwi','permissible']},
{id:'mu014',cat:'music',sub:'Nasheed',marja:'sistani',q:'Are Islamic nasheeds and songs with religious content permissible?',a:'Nasheeds (Islamic songs) are permissible if: (1) The melody is not in the style of sinful entertainment (lahwi mutrib — rhythmically arousing in the manner of entertainment gatherings), (2) The lyrics are halal (religious, ethical, positive content), (3) Not accompanied by haram instruments. What constitutes "lahwi mutrib" style versus dignified melodic recitation requires cultural context and scholarly evaluation. Traditional Islamic nasheeds, marthiyya (elegies for Ahlul Bayt), and devotional songs are widely accepted.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['nasheed','music','religious','halal','marthiyya','devotional']},
{id:'mu015',cat:'music',sub:'Nasheed',marja:'khamenei',q:'Are Islamic nasheeds and songs with religious content permissible?',a:'Islamic nasheeds, revolutionary songs, and devotional music with appropriate content and style are halal. The emphasis is on the totality: content (halal), style (dignified, not promoting sinful atmosphere), and context (appropriate occasion). Marthiyya and nawha (mourning poetry) for the Ahlul Bayt are not only permissible but highly encouraged — they are among the greatest acts of devotion. Celebratory nasheeds for Islamic occasions (Eid al-Ghadir, birthdays of Imams) are similarly praised.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['nasheed','music','religious','halal','marthiyya','devotional']},
{id:'mu016',cat:'music',sub:'Nasheed',marja:'noori',q:'Are Islamic nasheeds and songs with religious content permissible?',a:'The tradition of Islamic poetry set to melodious recitation goes back to the earliest days of Islam. The Ahlul Bayt (as) encouraged poetry in praise of their cause and in mourning their tragedies. Today, nasheeds serve as powerful tools for Islamic identity, education, and emotional connection to faith. The criteria for permissibility are: wholesome content, dignified delivery, and appropriate context. The vibrant tradition of Shia devotional music is a hallmark of the community.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['nasheed','music','religious','halal','marthiyya','devotional']},
{id:'mu017',cat:'music',sub:'Listening',marja:'sistani',q:'Is listening to music in the background (while working/driving) permissible?',a:'The ruling applies to the music itself regardless of the context — if the music is of the lahwi (sinful entertainment) type, it is haram whether listened to actively or as background. If it is non-lahwi (gentle, non-arousing melodies), it is permissible. Classical music, instrumental ambient music, and similar genres are matters of scholarly evaluation regarding whether they constitute lahwi. Many people use background sound — nature sounds, white noise, and classical music that is clearly not lahwi style are safer choices.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['music','background','listening','driving','working','permissible']},
{id:'mu018',cat:'music',sub:'Listening',marja:'makarem',q:'Is listening to music in the background (while working/driving) permissible?',a:'The context of listening (background vs. active) does not change the fundamental ruling — haram music is haram regardless. However, there is more leniency in the evaluation of what constitutes haram music: background instrumental music that is calm, non-arousing, and used for concentration or relaxation may not fall into the lahwi category. The stronger test is: would this music be appropriate for a sinful entertainment gathering? If the answer is clearly no (it\'s too calm, classical, or atmospheric), it is likely permissible.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['music','background','listening','driving','working','permissible']},

{id:'mu019',cat:'music',sub:'Nasheeds',marja:'sistani',q:'Are Islamic nasheeds (devotional songs) permissible?',a:'Nasheeds and Islamic devotional poetry recited without instruments associated with haram gatherings (lahwi instruments) are permissible. The content must be Islamic, moral, or educational. Rhythmic recitation of poetry praising the Prophet (s), the Ahlul Bayt (as), or expressing moral themes is a longstanding Islamic tradition. The issue is not melody itself but the association with lahw (vain entertainment) and gatherings of sin.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['nasheeds','devotional','poetry','permissible','recitation']},
{id:'mu020',cat:'music',sub:'Nasheeds',marja:'khamenei',q:'Are Islamic nasheeds (devotional songs) permissible?',a:'Religious nasheeds, recitations, and devotional music that: (1) have Islamic/moral content, (2) do not use instruments of lahw, (3) are not in the style of sinful gatherings — are permissible. The rich tradition of Shia devotional poetry (madh, marsiyah, noha) is an important part of religious culture. Revolutionary and motivational nasheeds are also permissible. The context and style matter more than melody alone.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['nasheeds','devotional','poetry','permissible','recitation']},
{id:'mu021',cat:'music',sub:'Nasheeds',marja:'makarem',q:'Are Islamic nasheeds (devotional songs) permissible?',a:'Nasheeds with Islamic content are permissible and encouraged. The tradition of devotional poetry in Islam goes back to Hassan ibn Thabit who composed poetry praising the Prophet (s). Eulogies (madh) for the Ahlul Bayt (as), lamentations (marsiyah) for Imam Hussain (as), and moral poetry are all permissible. Simple percussion (like duff) for Islamic occasions may be permissible according to some scholars. The criterion is content and context, not melody per se.',source:'Tawdih al-Masail / Istifta\'at',tags:['nasheeds','devotional','poetry','permissible','recitation']},
{id:'mu022',cat:'music',sub:'Instruments',marja:'sistani',q:'Which musical instruments are forbidden?',a:'Instruments that are traditionally and customarily associated with entertainment gatherings (lahw) and sinful assemblies are haram to play and listen to. This includes most conventional musical instruments when used in a lahwi manner. The criterion is \'urf (custom) — if an instrument is commonly associated with entertainment/sin gatherings in the local culture, it is prohibited. The same instrument used for marches, anthems, or educational purposes may have a different ruling.',source:'Minhaj al-Salihin / Tawdih al-Masail',tags:['instruments','music','forbidden','lahw','entertainment']},
{id:'mu023',cat:'music',sub:'Instruments',marja:'khamenei',q:'Which musical instruments are forbidden?',a:'The distinction is between instruments of lahw (entertainment associated with sin) and other uses. Instruments primarily used in haram gatherings are prohibited. However, the same instruments used for military marches, national anthems, educational purposes, or therapeutic contexts may be permissible. The ruling considers: the instrument, the style of playing, the context, and the content. Classical distinction between lahwi and non-lahwi music is key.',source:'Ajwibat al-Istifta\'at',tags:['instruments','music','forbidden','lahw','entertainment']},
